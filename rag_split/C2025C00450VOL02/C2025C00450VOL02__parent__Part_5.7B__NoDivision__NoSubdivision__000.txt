the company is to be presumed to have been insolvent throughout 
the period.
(4A) In determining for the purposes of the recovery proceeding 
whether a disposition of property of the company is a 
creditor-defeating disposition, the consideration payable to the 
company for the disposition is to be presumed to be less than both 
the market value of the property and the best price reasonably 
obtainable for the property, if it is proved that the company:
(a) has failed to keep financial records relating to the disposition 
as required by subsection 286(1); or
(b) has failed to retain financial records relating to the 
disposition for 7 years after the disposition as required by 
subsection 286(2).
This subsection is subject to subsections (5) and (6).
(5) Paragraphs (4)(a) and (4A)(a) do not apply in relation to a 
contravention of subsection 286(1) that is only minor or technical.
(6) A presumption under subsection (4) or (4A) of this section, 
applying because of a contravention of subsection 286(2), does not 
have effect so far as it would prejudice a right or interest of a 
person, if it is proved that:
(a) the contravention was due solely to someone destroying, 
concealing or removing financial records of the company; 
and
(b) none of those financial records was destroyed, concealed or 
removed by the first-mentioned person; and
(c) the person was not in any way, by act or omission, directly or 
indirectly, knowingly or recklessly, concerned in, or party to, 
destroying, concealing or removing any of those financial 
records.
