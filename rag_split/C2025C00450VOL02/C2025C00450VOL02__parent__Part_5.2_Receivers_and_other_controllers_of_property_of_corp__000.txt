Part 5.2  Receivers, and other controllers, of property of corporations
Section 419A

Corporations Act 2001 301
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(3) Within 7 days after the control day, the controller may give to the 
owner or lessor a notice that specifies the third party property and 
states that the controller does not propose to exercise rights in 
relation to that property as controller of the property, whether on 
behalf of the corporation or anyone else.
(4) Despite subsection (2), the controller is not liable for so much of 
the rent or other amounts payable by the corporation under the 
agreement as is attributable to a period during which a notice under 
subsection (3) is in force, but such a notice does not affect a 
liability of the corporation.
(5) A notice under subsection (3) ceases to have effect if:
(a) the controller revokes it by writing given to the owner or 
lessor; or
(b) the controller exercises, or purports to exercise, a right in 
relation to the third party property as controller of the 
property, whether on behalf of the corporation or anyone 
else.
(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the controller does not exercise, 
or purport to exercise, a right as mentioned in paragraph (5)(b) 
merely because the controller continues to be in possession, or to 
have control, of the third party property, unless the controller:
(a) also uses the property; or
(b) asserts a right, as against the owner or lessor, so to continue.
(7) Subsection (2) does not apply in so far as a court, by order, excuses 
the controller from liability, but an order does not affect a liability 
of the corporation.
(8) The controller is not taken because of subsection (2):
(a) to have adopted the agreement; or
(b) to be liable under the agreement otherwise than as mentioned 
in subsection (2).
