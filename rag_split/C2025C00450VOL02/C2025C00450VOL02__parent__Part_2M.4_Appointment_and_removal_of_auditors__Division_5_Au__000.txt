Division 5  Auditor rotation for listed companies, listed registered schemes and
Subdivision A—Appointment of company auditors

325  Appointment of auditor by proprietary company

(1) The directors of a proprietary company may appoint an auditor for 
the company if an auditor has not been appointed by the company 
in general meeting.
(2) The directors of a proprietary company must ensure that there is an 
auditor for the company at all times during the period:
(a) starting 1 month after:
(i) the time the company first raises a total equal to or 
exceeding the CSF audit threshold from all the CSF 
offers it has ever made; or
(ii) if the period starting because of subparagraph (i), or 
because of an earlier operation of this subparagraph, has 
ended—the time the company makes a later CSF offer; 
and
(b) when the company ceases to have any CSF shareholders at a 
later time in a particular financial year—ending when the 
company’s financial report for that financial year has been 
audited.
(3) However, subsection (2) does not apply for any period of 1 month 
or less starting when a vacancy occurs in the office of auditor of 
the company (however that vacancy is caused).
(4) A director of a company must take all reasonable steps to comply 
with, or to secure compliance with, subsection (2).
