454J  Scope of sections 454K to 454M

Sections 454K to 454M do not apply in relation to the enforcement 
of a right, or the performance or exercise of a function or power, if 
the enforcement, performance or exercise is authorised by (or 
because of) a transaction or dealing that gives rise to a security 
interest in the property concerned.
Example: An example of a transaction or dealing in relation to which 
sections 454K to 454M do not apply because of this section is a 
commercial consignment of personal property. Such a transaction 
gives rise to a PPSA security interest because of section 12 of the 
Personal Property Securities Act 2009. The consigned property is 
PPSA retention of title property of the company (see sections 51F and

Part 5.3B  Restructuring of a company
Division 2  Restructuring
452B).

Note: Sections 454C to 454H (property subject to security interests) may 
apply in relation to transactions or dealings to which this Subdivision 
does not apply because of this section. For example, sections 454C to

Part 5.3B  Restructuring of a company
Division 2  Restructuring
454H would apply in relation to a commercial consignment of

personal property, because such a transaction gives rise to a PPSA 
security interest.
