420A  Controller’s duty of care in exercising power of sale

(1) In exercising a power of sale in respect of property of a 
corporation, a controller must take all reasonable care to sell the 
property for:
(a) if, when it is sold, it has a market value—not less than that 
market value; or
(b) otherwise—the best price that is reasonably obtainable, 
having regard to the circumstances existing when the 
property is sold.
(2) Nothing in subsection (1) limits the generality of anything in 
section 180, 181, 182, 183 or 184.

Part 5.2  Receivers, and other controllers, of property of corporations
420B  Court may authorise managing controller to dispose of

property despite prior security interest
(1) On the application of a managing controller of property of a 
corporation, the Court may by order authorise the controller to sell, 
or to dispose of in some other specified way, specified property of 
the corporation, even though it is subject to a security interest (the 
prior security interest) that has priority over a security interest (the 
controller’s security interest) in that property that the controller is 
enforcing.
(2) However, the Court may only make an order if satisfied that:
(a) apart from the existence of the prior security interest, the 
controller would have power to sell, or to so dispose of, the 
property; and
(b) the controller has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the 
consent of the secured party in relation to the prior security 
interest to the sale or disposal, but has not obtained that 
consent; and

Section 420B

Corporations Act 2001 305
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(c) sale or disposal of the property under the order is in the best 
interests of the corporation’s creditors and of the corporation; 
and
(d) sale or disposal of the property under the order will not 
unreasonably prejudice the rights or interests of the secured 
party in relation to the prior security interest.
(3) The Court is to have regard to the need to protect adequately the 
rights and interests of the secured party in relation to the prior 
security interest.
(4) If the property would be sold or disposed of together with other 
property that is subject to the controller’s security interest, the 
Court may have regard to:
(a) the amount (if any) by which it is reasonable to expect that 
the net proceeds of selling or disposing of that other property 
otherwise than together with the first-mentioned property 
would be less than so much of the net proceeds of selling or 
disposing of all the property together as would be attributable 
to that other property; and
(b) the amount (if any) by which it is reasonable to expect that 
the net proceeds of selling or disposing of the first-mentioned 
property otherwise than together with the other property 
would be greater than so much of the net proceeds of selling 
or disposing of all the property together as would be 
attributable to the first-mentioned property.
(5) Nothing in subsection (3) or (4) limits the matters to which the 
Court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (2).
(6) An order may be made subject to conditions, for example (but 
without limitation):
(a) a condition that:
(i) the net proceeds of the sale or disposal; and
(ii) the net proceeds of the sale or disposal of such other 
property (if any) as is specified in the condition and is 
subject to the controller’s security interest;
