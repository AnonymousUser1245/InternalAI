Part 5.7B
Subdivision A—Kinds of transactions that may be voidable
588FA  Meaning of unfair preference

(1) A transaction is an unfair preference given by a company to a 
creditor of the company if, and only if:
(a) the company and the creditor are parties to the transaction 
(even if someone else is also a party); and
(b) the transaction results in the creditor receiving from the 
company, in respect of an unsecured debt that the company 
owes to the creditor, more than the creditor would receive 
from the company in respect of the debt if the transaction 
were set aside and the creditor were to prove for the debt in a 
winding up of the company;
even if the transaction is entered into, is given effect to, or is 
required to be given effect to, because of an order of an Australian 
court or a direction by an agency.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a secured debt is taken to be 
unsecured to the extent of so much of it (if any) as is not reflected 
in the value of the security.

(3) Where:
(a) a transaction is, for commercial purposes, an integral part of 
a continuing business relationship (for example, a running 
account) between a company and a creditor of the company 
(including such a relationship to which other persons are 
parties); and
(b) in the course of the relationship, the level of the company’s 
net indebtedness to the creditor is increased and reduced from 
time to time as the result of a series of transactions forming 
part of the relationship;
