came into force, or the time that is the critical time, 
whichever time is earlier;
(iii) if the security agreement giving rise to the security 
interest came into force under the law of a foreign 
jurisdiction, but the security interest first became 
enforceable against third parties under the law of 
Australia after the time that is 6 months before the 
critical timeâ€”the time that is the end of 56 days after 
the security interest became so enforceable, or the time 
that is the critical time, whichever time is earlier;
(iv) a later time ordered by the Court under section 588FM.
