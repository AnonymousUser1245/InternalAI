564  Power of Court to make orders in favour of certain creditors

Where in any winding up:
(a) property has been recovered under an indemnity for costs of 
litigation given by certain creditors, or has been protected or 
preserved by the payment of money or the giving of 
indemnity by creditors; or
(b) expenses in relation to which a creditor has indemnified a 
liquidator have been recovered;
the Court may make such orders, as it deems just with respect to 
the distribution of that property and the amount of those expenses 
so recovered with a view to giving those creditors an advantage 
over others in consideration of the risk assumed by them.
