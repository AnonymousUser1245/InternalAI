434LA  Self-executing provisions

(1) The object of subsection (2) is to ensure that a self-executing 
provision:
(a) cannot start to apply against a corporation for certain reasons; 
and
(b) can be the subject of a Court order providing that the 
provision can only start to apply against a corporation with 
the leave of the Court, and in accordance with such terms (if 
any) as the Court imposes.
(2) Sections 434J to 434L also apply in relation to a self-executing 
provision in a corresponding way to the way they apply in relation 
to a right. For this purpose, assume those sections apply with such 
modifications as are necessary, including any prescribed by the 
regulations for the purposes of this subsection.
Note 1: This subsection achieves the object in subsection (1) by extending the 
application of all of the outcomes, exceptions and powers in 
sections 434J to 434L.
Note 2: These modifications include, for example, treating:
(a) a reference that a right cannot be enforced (however described) 
as including a reference that a self-executing provision cannot 
start to apply; and
(b) the words “if the right arises for that reason by express provision 
(however described) of a contract, agreement or arrangement” as 
being omitted from subsection 434J(1); and
(c) a reference that one or more rights are enforceable as including a 
reference that one or more self-executing provisions can start to 
apply; and
