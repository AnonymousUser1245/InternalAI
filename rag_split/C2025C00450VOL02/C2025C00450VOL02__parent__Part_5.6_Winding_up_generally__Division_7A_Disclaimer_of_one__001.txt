568E  Application to set aside disclaimer after it has taken effect

(1) With the leave of the Court, a person who has, or claims to have, 
an interest in disclaimed property may apply to the Court for an 
order setting aside the disclaimer after it has taken effect.
(2) The Court may give leave only if it is satisfied that it is 
unreasonable in all the circumstances to expect the person to have 
applied for an order setting aside the disclaimer before it took 
effect.
(3) The Court may give leave subject to conditions.
(4) On an application under subsection (1), the Court:
(a) may by order set aside the disclaimer; and
(b) if it does so—may make such further orders as it thinks 
appropriate, including orders necessary to put the company,

(5) However, the Court may set aside a disclaimer only if satisfied that 
the disclaimer has caused, or would cause, to persons who have, or 
claim to have, interests in the property, prejudice that is grossly out 
of proportion to the prejudice that setting aside the disclaimer (and 
making any further orders) would cause to:
(a) the company’s creditors; and
(b) persons who have changed their position in reliance on the 
disclaimer taking effect.

(1) The Court may order that disclaimed property vest in, or be 
delivered to:
(a) a person entitled to the property; or
(b) a person in or to whom it seems to the Court appropriate that

(2) The Court may make an order under subsection (1):
(a) on the application of a person who claims an interest in the 
property, or is under a liability in respect of the property that 
this Act has not discharged; and
(b) after hearing such persons as it thinks appropriate.
(3) Subject to subsection (4), where an order is made under 
subsection (1) vesting property, the property vests immediately, for 
the purposes of the order, without any conveyance, transfer or 
assignment.

569  Executions, attachments etc. before winding up

(1) Where:
(a) a creditor has issued execution against property of a 
company, or instituted proceedings to attach a debt due to a 
company or to enforce a charge or a charging order against 
property of a company, within 6 months immediately before 
the commencement of the winding up; and
(b) the company commences to be wound up;
the creditor must pay to the liquidator an amount equal to the 
amount (if any) received by the creditor as a result of the 
execution, attachment or enforcement of the charge or the charging 
order, less an amount in respect of the costs of the execution, 
attachment or enforcement of the charge or the charging order, 
being an amount agreed between the creditor and the liquidator or, 
if no agreement is reached, an amount equal to the taxed cost of 
that execution, attachment or enforcement.
(2) Where the creditor has paid to the liquidator an amount in 
accordance with subsection (1), the creditor may prove in the 
winding up for the creditor’s debt as an unsecured creditor as if the 
execution or attachment or the enforcement of the charge or the 
charging order, as the case may be, had not taken place.
(3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), where a creditor of a company 
receives:
(a) notice in writing of an application to the Court for the 
winding up of the company; or
(b) notice in writing of the convening of a meeting of the 
company to consider a resolution that the company be wound 
up voluntarily;
it is not competent for the creditor to take any action, or any further 
action, as the case may be, to attach a debt due to the company or
