Part 11.2, this Part applies in relation to a receiver of property of a

corporation who is appointed after 1 January 1991, even if the 
appointment arose out of a transaction entered into, or an act or 
thing done, before 1 January 1991.

(2) To avoid doubt, this Part does not apply, of its own force, to the 
property of a corporation that is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander corporation.

Note 1: The definition of property in section 416 does not define that term in 
relation to a corporation that is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander corporation.
