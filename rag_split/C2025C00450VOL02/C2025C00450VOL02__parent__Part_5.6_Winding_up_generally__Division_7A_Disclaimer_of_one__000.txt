Division 7A  Disclaimer of onerous property
568  Disclaimer by liquidator; application to Court by party to

contract
(1) Subject to this section, a liquidator of a company may at any time, 
on the company’s behalf, by signed writing disclaim property of 
the company that consists of:
(a) land burdened with onerous covenants; or
(b) shares; or
(c) property that is unsaleable or is not readily saleable; or
(d) property that may give rise to a liability to pay money or 
some other onerous obligation; or
(e) property where it is reasonable to expect that the costs, 
charges and expenses that would be incurred in realising the 
property would exceed the proceeds of realising the property; 
or
(f) a contract;
whether or not:
(g) except in the case of a contract—the liquidator has tried to 
sell the property, has taken possession of it or exercised an 
act of ownership in relation to it; or
(h) in the case of a contract—the company or the liquidator has 
tried to assign, or has exercised rights in relation to, the 
contract or any property to which it relates.
(1AA) This section does not apply to:
(a) an agreement by the company to buy back its own shares; or
(b) PPSA retention of title property that is taken to form part of 
the property of the company because of the definition of 
property in section 513AA.
Note: The definition of property in section 513AA includes PPSA retention 
of title property of the company, if the security interest in the property 
has vested in the company in certain situations.

Section 568

Corporations Act 2001 625
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(1A) A liquidator cannot disclaim a contract (other than an unprofitable 
contract or a lease of land) except with the leave of the Court.
(1B) On an application for leave under subsection (1A), the Court may:
(a) grant leave subject to such conditions; and
(b) make such orders in connection with matters arising under, or 
relating to, the contract;
as the Court considers just and equitable.
(8) Where:
(a) an application in writing has been made to the liquidator by a 
person interested in property requiring the liquidator to 
decide whether he or she will disclaim the property; and
(b) the liquidator has, for the period of 28 days after the receipt 
of the application, or for such extended period as is allowed 
by the Court, declined or neglected to disclaim the property;
the liquidator is not entitled to disclaim the property under this 
section and, in the case of a contract, he or she is taken to have 
adopted it.
(9) The Court may, on the application of a person who is, as against 
the company, entitled to the benefit or subject to the burden of a 
contract made with the company, make an order:
(a) discharging the contract on such terms as to payment by or to 
either party of damages for the non-performance of the 
contract, or otherwise, as the Court thinks proper; or
(b) rescinding the contract on such terms as to restitution by or to 
either party, or otherwise, as the Court thinks proper.
(10) Amounts payable pursuant to an order under subsection (9) may be 
proved as a debt in the winding up.
(13) For the purpose of determining whether property of a company is 
of a kind to which subsection (1) applies, the liquidator may, by 
notice served on a person claiming to have an interest in the 
property, require the person to give to the liquidator within such 
period, not being less than 14 days, as is specified in the notice, a

(1) As soon as practicable after disclaiming property, a liquidator 
must:
(a) lodge a written notice of the disclaimer; and
(b) give written notice of the disclaimer to each person who 
appears to the liquidator to have, or to claim to have, an 
interest in the property; and
(c) if the liquidator has reason to suspect that some person or 
persons may have, or may claim to have, an interest or 
interests in the property, but either does not know who, or 
does not know where, the person is or the persons are—
comply with subsection (2); and
(d) if a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory 
requires the transfer or transmission of the property to be 
registered—give written notice of the disclaimer to the 
registrar or other person who has the function under that law 
of registering the transfer or transmission of the property.

(1) A person who has, or claims to have, an interest in disclaimed 
property may apply to the Court for an order setting aside the 
disclaimer before it takes effect, but may only do so within 14 days 
after:
(a) if the liquidator gives to the person notice of the disclaimer, 
because of paragraph 568A(1)(b), before the end of 14 days 
after the liquidator lodges such notice—the liquidator gives 
such notice to the person; or
(b) if paragraph (a) does not apply but notice of the disclaimer is

(2) On an application under subsection (1), the Court:
(a) may by order set aside the disclaimer; and
(b) if it does so—may make such further orders as it thinks 
appropriate.
(3) However, the Court may set aside a disclaimer under this section 
only if satisfied that the disclaimer would cause, to persons who 
have, or claim to have, interests in the property, prejudice that is 
grossly out of proportion to the prejudice that setting aside the 
disclaimer would cause to the company’s creditors.

such applications, is made within the period that that section 
prescribes for making the application—the application, or 
each of the applications, is unsuccessful; or
(b) no such application is so made.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an application under 
section 568B is successful if, and only if, the result of the 
application, and all appeals (if any) arising out of the application, 
being finally determined or otherwise disposed of is an order 
setting aside the disclaimer (whether or not further orders are also 
made).
(3) A disclaimer that takes effect because of subsection (1) is taken to 
have taken effect on the day after:
(a) if:
(i) the liquidator gave to a person notice of the disclaimer 
because of paragraph 568A(1)(b); or
