entitlements of one or more employees (within the meaning 
of Part 5.8A) of the insolvent company that are protected 
under Part 5.8A has not been paid; and

order group (see subsection (6)) as the insolvent company; 
and
(d) the contributing entity has benefited, directly or indirectly, 
from work done by those employees; and
