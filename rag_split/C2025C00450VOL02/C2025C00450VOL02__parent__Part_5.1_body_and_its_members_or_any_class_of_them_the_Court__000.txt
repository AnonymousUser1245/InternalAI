company; or
(ii) if the holding company is being wound upâ€”of the 
liquidator;
that the number of meetings that would be required between

arrangements would be so great as to result in a significant 
impediment to the timely and effective consideration by 
those creditors of the terms of the compromises or 
arrangements;
the Court may order a meeting or meetings, on a consolidated 
basis, of the creditors of the holding company and of each of the 
subsidiaries or of such class or classes of those creditors as the 
Court determines and, where the Court makes such an order, the

paragraph 412(1)(a) to accompany notices of the meeting or 
meetings.

justify its doing so;
the Court may make an order under subsection (1A) in relation to 
the proposed compromise or arrangement.
(1C) Where an order is made under subsection (1A) in relation to a 
proposed compromise or arrangement, the succeeding provisions
