Objects
(1) The objects of this Part are to:
(a) deter avoidance of the payment of the entitlements of 
employees; and
(b) protect the entitlements of a company’s employees from 
agreements, arrangements and transactions that avoid or 
prevent the recovery of those entitlements, or significantly 
reduce the amount of those entitlements that can be 
recovered, in the winding up of the company.

company by the employee; and

(including defined benefits) for the employee, or for 
dependants of the employee) payable by the company in 
respect of services rendered to the company by the employee;

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025instrument, in respect of the termination of the employee’s 
employment by the company).
(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2), an entitlement of an employee 
need not be owed to the employee. It might, for example, be:
(a) an amount owed to the employee’s dependants; or
(b) a superannuation contribution payable to a fund in respect of 
services rendered by the employee; or
(c) a right in relation to an entitlement that becomes a right of 
the Commonwealth under paragraph 31(1)(b) of the Fair 
Entitlements Guarantee Act 2012; or
(d) an entitlement in relation to which an entity other than the 
employee has a right of subrogation.
(3) The entitlements of an excluded employee (within the meaning of 
section 556) are protected under this Part only to the extent to 
which they have priority under paragraph 556(1)(e), (f), (g) or (h).
Employees
(4) For the purposes of this Part, a person is an employee of a company 
if the person is, or has been, an employee of the company (whether 
remunerated by salary, wages, commission or otherwise).
(5) If an entitlement of an employee of a company is owed to a person 
other than the employee, this Part applies to the entitlement as if a 
reference to the employee included a reference to the person to 
whom the entitlement is owed.
