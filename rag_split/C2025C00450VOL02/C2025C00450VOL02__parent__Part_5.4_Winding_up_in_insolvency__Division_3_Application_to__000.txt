offsetting claims—the total of the amounts of those claims; 
or
(c) otherwise—a nil amount.
(3) If the substantiated amount is less than the statutory minimum, the 
Court must, by order, set aside the demand.
(4) If the substantiated amount is at least as great as the statutory 
minimum, the Court may make an order:

(b) declaring the demand to have had effect, as so varied, as from 
when the demand was served on the company.
(5) In this section:
admitted amount, in relation to a debt, means:
(a) if the Court is satisfied that there is a genuine dispute 
between the company and the respondent about the existence 
of the debt—a nil amount; or

of the debt—so much of that amount as the Court is satisfied 
is not the subject of such a dispute; or
(c) otherwise—the amount of the debt.
offsetting claim means a genuine claim that the company has 
against the respondent by way of counterclaim, set-off or 
cross-demand (even if it does not arise out of the same transaction 
or circumstances as a debt to which the demand relates).
