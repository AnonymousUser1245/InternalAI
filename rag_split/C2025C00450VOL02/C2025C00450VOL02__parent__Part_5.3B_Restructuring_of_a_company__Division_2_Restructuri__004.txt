454R  Self-executing provisions

(1) The object of subsection (2) is to ensure that a self-executing 
provision:
(a) cannot start to apply against a company for certain reasons; 
and
(b) can be the subject of a Court order providing that the 
provision can only start to apply against a company with the 
leave of the Court, and in accordance with such terms (if any) 
as the Court imposes.
(2) Sections 454N to 454Q also apply in relation to a self-executing 
provision in a corresponding way to the way they apply in relation 
to a right. For this purpose, assume those sections apply with such 
modifications as are necessary, including any prescribed by the 
regulations for the purposes of this subsection.
