452 Corporations Act 2001

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(a) a guarantee of a liability of the company cannot be enforced, 
as against:
(i) a director of the company who is a natural person; or
(ii) a spouse or relative of such a director; and
(b) without limiting paragraph (a), a proceeding in relation to 
such a guarantee cannot be begun against such a director, 
spouse or relative;
except with the leave of the Court and in accordance with such 
terms (if any) as the Court imposes.
(2) While subsection (1) prevents a person (the creditor) from:
(a) enforcing as against another person (the guarantor) a 
guarantee of a liability of a company; or
(b) beginning a proceeding against another person (the 
guarantor) in relation to such a guarantee;
section 1323 applies in relation to the creditor and the guarantor as 
if:
(c) a civil proceeding against the guarantor had begun under this 
Act; and
(d) the creditor were the only person of a kind referred to in that 
section as an aggrieved person.
Note: Under section 1323, the Court can make a range of orders to ensure 
that a person can meet the person’s liabilities.
(3) The effect that section 1323 has because of a particular application 
of subsection (2) is additional to, and does not prejudice, the effect 
the section otherwise has.
(4) In this section:
guarantee, in relation to a liability of a company, includes a 
relevant agreement (as defined in section 9) because of which a 
person other than the company has incurred, or may incur, whether 
jointly with the company or otherwise, a liability in respect of the 
liability of the company.
liability means a debt, liability or other obligation.
