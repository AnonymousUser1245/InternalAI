restructuring etc.
Stay on enforcing rights
(1) A right cannot be enforced against a company for:
(a) the reason that the company has come or is under 
restructuring; or
(b) the company’s financial position, if the company is under 
restructuring; or
(c) a reason, prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of 
this paragraph, that relates to:
(i) the company coming, or possibly coming, under 
restructuring; or
(ii) the company’s financial position;
if the company later comes under restructuring; or
(d) a reason that, in substance, is contrary to this subsection;
if the right arises for that reason by express provision (however 
described) of a contract, agreement or arrangement.
Note: This result is subject to subsections (5) and (7), and to any order under 
section 454P.
Example: A right to terminate a contract will not be enforceable to the extent 
that those rights are triggered by the company coming under 
restructuring.
