562A  Application of proceeds of contracts of reinsurance

(1) This section applies where:
(a) a company is insured, under a contract of reinsurance entered 
into before the relevant date, against liability to pay amounts 
in respect of a relevant contract of insurance or relevant 
contracts of insurance; and
(b) an amount in respect of that liability has been or is received 
by the company or the liquidator under the contract of 
reinsurance.
(2) Subject to subsection (4), if the amount received, after deducting 
expenses of or incidental to getting in that amount, equals or 
exceeds the total of all the amounts that are payable by the 
company under relevant contracts of insurance, the liquidator must, 
out of the amount received and in priority to all payments in 
respect of the debts mentioned in section 556, pay the amounts that 
are so payable under those contracts of insurance.

Section 562A

Corporations Act 2001 615
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(3) Subject to subsection (4), if subsection (2) does not apply, the 
liquidator must, out of the amount received and in priority to all 
payments in respect of the debts mentioned in section 556, pay to 
each person to whom an amount is payable by the company under 
a relevant contract of insurance an amount calculated in 
accordance with the formula:
where:
particular amount owed means the amount payable to the person 
under the relevant contract of insurance.
reinsurance payment means the amount received under the 
contract of reinsurance, less any expenses of or incidental to 
getting in that amount.
total amount owed means the total of all the amounts payable by 
the company under relevant contracts of insurance.
(4) The Court may, on application by a person to whom an amount is 
payable under a relevant contract of insurance, make an order to 
the effect that subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to the amount 
received under the contract of reinsurance and that that amount 
must, instead, be applied by the liquidator in the manner specified 
in the order, being a manner that the Court considers just and 
equitable in the circumstances.
(5) The matters that the Court may take into account in considering 
whether to make an order under subsection (4) include, but are not 
limited to:
(a) whether it is possible to identify particular relevant contracts 
of insurance as being the contracts in respect of which the 
contract of reinsurance was entered into; and
(b) whether it is possible to identify persons who can be said to 
have paid extra in order to have particular relevant contracts 
of insurance protected by reinsurance; andParticular amount owedReinsurance paymentTotal amount owed´
