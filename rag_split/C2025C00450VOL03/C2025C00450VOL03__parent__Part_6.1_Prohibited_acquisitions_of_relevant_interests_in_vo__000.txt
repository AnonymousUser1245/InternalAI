Part 6.1  Prohibited acquisitions of relevant interests in voting shares
188 Corporations Act 2001

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(b) there is an increase in the number of votes that may be cast 
on a poll attached to voting shares that the person already had 
a relevant interest in.
The acquisition occurs when the securities become voting shares or 
the number of votes increases.
Note: Some examples of cases to which this subsection applies are:
•A person exercises a right to convert a non-voting preference 
share into an ordinary share that carries votes.
•A person pays up partly-paid shares with limited votes and 
this leads to an increase in the number of votes attached to the 
shares.

A transaction is not invalid merely because it involves a 
contravention of section 606.

Part 6.1  Prohibited acquisitions of relevant interests in voting shares
608  Relevant interests in securities

Basic rule—relevant interest is holding, or controlling voting or 
disposal of, securities
(1) A person has a relevant interest in securities if they:
(a) are the holder of the securities; or
(b) have power to exercise, or control the exercise of, a right to 
vote attached to the securities; or
(c) have power to dispose of, or control the exercise of a power 
to dispose of, the securities.
It does not matter how remote the relevant interest is or how it 
arises. If 2 or more people can jointly exercise one of these powers, 
each of them is taken to have that power.
Extension to control exercisable through a trust, agreement or 
practice
(2) In this section, power or control includes:
(a) power or control that is indirect; and

Section 608

Corporations Act 2001 189
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(b) power or control that is, or can be, exercised as a result of, by 
means of or by the revocation or breach of:
(i) a trust; or
(ii) an agreement; or
(iii) a practice; or
(iv) any combination of them;
whether or not they are enforceable; and
(c) power or control that is, or can be made, subject to restraint 
or restriction.
It does not matter whether the power or control is express or 
implied, formal or informal, exercisable alone or jointly with 
someone else. It does not matter that the power or control cannot 
be related to a particular security.
Extension to relevant interests held through bodies corporate
(3) A person has the relevant interests in any securities that any of the 
following has:
(a) a body corporate, or managed investment scheme, in which 
the person’s voting power is above 20%;
(b) a body corporate, or managed investment scheme, that the 
person controls.
Paragraph (a) does not apply to a relevant interest that the body 
corporate or scheme itself has in the securities merely because of 
the operation of that paragraph in relation to another body 
corporate or managed investment scheme.
(4) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(b), a person controls a body 
corporate if the person has the capacity to determine the outcome 
of decisions about the body corporate’s financial and operating 
policies.
(5) In determining whether a person has this capacity:
(a) the practical influence the person can exert (rather than the 
rights they can enforce) is the issue to be addressed; and
(b) any practice or pattern of behaviour affecting the body 
corporate’s financial or operating policies is to be taken into
