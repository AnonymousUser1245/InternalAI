610  Voting power in a body or managed investment scheme

Person’s voting power in a body or managed investment scheme
(1) A person’s voting power in a designated body is:
where:
person’s and associates’ votes is the total number of votes attached 
to all the voting shares in the designated body (if any) that the 
person or an associate has a relevant interest in.
total votes in designated body is the total number of votes attached 
to all voting shares in the designated body.
Note: Even if a person’s relevant interest in voting shares is based on control 
over disposal of the shares (rather than control over voting rights 
attached to the shares), their voting power in the designated body is 
calculated on the basis of the number of votes attached to those shares.Person’s and associates’ votes  100Total votes in designated body´

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Counting votes
(2) For the purposes of this section, the number of votes attached to a 
voting share in a designated body is the maximum number of votes 
that can be cast in respect of the share on a poll:
(a) if the election of directors is determined by the casting of 
votes attached to voting shares—on the election of a director 
of the designated body; or
(b) if the election of directors is not determined by the casting of 
votes attached to voting shares—on the adoption of a 
constitution for the designated body or the amendment of the 
body corporate’s constitution.
Note: The Takeovers Panel may decide that the setting or varying of voting 
rights in a way that affects control of a designated body is 
unacceptable circumstances under section 657A.
(3) If:
(a) a transaction in relation to, or an acquisition of an interest in, 
securities occurs; and
(b) before the transaction or acquisition, a person did not have a 
relevant interest in particular voting shares but an associate 
of the person did have a relevant interest in those shares; and
(c) because of the transaction or acquisition, the person acquires 
a relevant interest in those shares;
then, for the purposes of applying section 606 to the transaction or 
acquisition, the person’s voting power is taken to have increased 
because of the transaction or acquisition from what it would have 
been before the transaction or acquisition if the votes attached to 
those shares were disregarded to what it was after the transaction 
or acquisition (taking the votes attached to those shares into 
account).
(3A) However, subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a subsidiary 
acquiring an interest in securities from its holding company with 
the result that the subsidiary acquires a relevant interest in 
particular voting shares unless:
(a) the acquisition results in an increase of another person’s 
voting power in a designated body; and
