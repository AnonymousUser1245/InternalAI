made outside bid
Effect of purchases outside bid on offers made under the bid

contracts, are varied under this section if:

during the bid period; and:
(b) the consideration for that purchase consists solely of a cash 
sum; and
(c) either:

payable under the bid consists of a cash sum only and 
the consideration referred to in paragraph (b) is higher 
than the cash sum payable for the securities under the 
bid; or

forms of consideration, payable under the bid.

(a) one of the forms of consideration offered to a person under 
an off-market bid is a cash sum only; and
(b) the person has not accepted the offer before the purchase 
outside the bid occurs;
the cash sum is taken to be increased to the highest outside 
purchase price before the offer is accepted.
