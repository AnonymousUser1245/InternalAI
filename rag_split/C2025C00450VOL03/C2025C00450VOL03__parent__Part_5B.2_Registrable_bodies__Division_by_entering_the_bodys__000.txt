Part 5B.2  Registrable bodies
Division by entering the body’s name in a register kept for
601CC  Cessation of business etc.

(1) Within 7 days after ceasing to carry on business interstate, a 
registered Australian body must lodge written notice that it has so 
ceased.
(1A) For the purposes of this section, a body carries on business 
interstate if, and only if, the body carries on business at a place 
that is in this jurisdiction and outside the body’s place of origin.
(2) Where ASIC has reasonable cause to believe that a registered 
Australian body does not carry on business interstate, ASIC may 
send to the body in the prescribed manner a letter to that effect and 
stating that, if no answer showing cause to the contrary is received 
within one month from the date of the letter, a notice will be 
published in the Gazette with a view to striking the body’s name 
off the register.
(3) Unless ASIC receives, within one month after the date of the letter, 
an answer to the effect that the body is still carrying on business 
interstate, it may publish in the Gazette, and send to the body in the 
prescribed manner, a notice that, at the end of 3 months after the 
date of the notice, the body’s name will, unless cause to the 
contrary is shown, be struck off the register.
(4) At the end of the period specified in a notice sent under 
subsection (3), ASIC may, unless cause to the contrary has been 
shown, strike the body’s name off the register and must publish in 
the Gazette notice of the striking off.
(5) Nothing in subsection (4) affects the power of the Court to wind up 
a body whose name has been struck off the register.
