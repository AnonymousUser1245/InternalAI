Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(6) Where a body’s name is struck off the register under 
subsection (4), the body ceases to be registered under this Division.
(7) If ASIC is satisfied that a body’s name was struck off the register 
as a result of an error on ASIC’s part, ASIC may restore the body’s 
name to the register, and thereupon the body’s name is taken never 
to have been struck off and the body is taken never to have ceased 
to be registered under this Division.
(8) A person who is aggrieved by a body’s name having been struck 
off the register may, within 15 years after the striking off, apply to 
the Court for the body’s name to be restored to the register.
(9) If, on an application under subsection (8), the Court is satisfied 
that:
(a) at the time of the striking off, the body was carrying on 
business interstate; or
(b) it is otherwise just for the body’s name to be restored to the 
register;
the Court may, by order:
(c) direct the body’s name to be restored to the register; and
(d) give such directions, and make such provisions, as it thinks 
just for placing the body and all other persons in the same 
position, as nearly as practicable, as if the body’s name had 
never been struck off.
(10) On the lodging of an office copy of an order under subsection (9), 
the body’s name is taken never to have been struck off.

subsection (7) or (9), ASIC must cause notice of that fact to be 
published in the Gazette.

obligation to lodge a document that this Act imposes on the body

event, at or before the time when the body so ceased, being an 
obligation not discharged at or before that time, continues to apply

the Court:

the property of the body that is located:
(i) in this jurisdiction; and
(ii) outside the body’s place of origin;
and must pay the net amount so recovered and realised to the 
liquidator of the body for its place of origin.
(15) If a registered Australian body has been wound up so far as its 
property located:
(a) in this jurisdiction; and
(b) outside its place of origin;
is concerned and there is no liquidator for its place of origin, the 
liquidator may apply to the Court for directions about the disposal 
of the net amount recovered under subsection (14).
