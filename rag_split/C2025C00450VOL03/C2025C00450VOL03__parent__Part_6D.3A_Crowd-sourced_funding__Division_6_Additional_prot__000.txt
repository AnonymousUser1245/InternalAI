738ZC  Caps on investment by retail clients pursuant to CSF offers

(1) The responsible intermediary for a CSF offer must reject an 
application made by a person pursuant to the offer if:
(a) the person is a retail client in relation to the offer; and
(b) having regard only to CSF offers for which the intermediary 
is the responsible intermediary, the application would result 
in the total amount paid or payable by the person in respect 
of applications made by the person, in any period of 12 
months, pursuant to CSF offers made by the same company, 
exceeding:
(i) $10,000; or
(ii) if the regulations prescribe a different amount—the 
prescribed amount.
Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see 
subsection 1311(1)).
(2) If 2 or more persons (the joint applicants) make a joint application 
for the issue of securities pursuant to a CSF offer, then, unless the 
regulations provide otherwise, this section applies in relation to the 
joint application as if each of the joint applicants had instead made 
a separate application for a number of securities worked out by 
dividing the number of securities applied for in the joint 
application by the number of joint applicants.
