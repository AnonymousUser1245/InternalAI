order but not including an order directing a person to comply with 
a requirement of Chapter 6, 6A, 6B or 6C) that it thinks appropriate 
to:
(a) if the Takeovers Panel is satisfied that the rights or interests 
of any person, or group of persons, have been or are being 
affected, or will be or are likely to be affected, by the 
circumstances—protect those rights or interests, or any other 
rights or interests, of that person or group of persons; or
(b) ensure that a takeover bid or proposed takeover bid in 
relation to securities proceeds (as far as possible) in a way 
that it would have proceeded if the circumstances had not 
occurred; or
(c) specify in greater detail the requirements of an order made 
under this subsection; or
(d) determine who is to bear the costs of the parties to the 
proceedings before the Takeovers Panel;
regardless of whether it has previously made an order under this 
subsection or section 657E in relation to the declaration. The 
Takeovers Panel may also make any ancillary or consequential 
orders that it thinks appropriate.
Note: Section 9 defines remedial order.
