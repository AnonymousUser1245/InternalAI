Division 1—Compulsory acquisition of bid class securities
661A  Compulsory acquisition power following takeover bid

Threshold for compulsory acquisition power
(1) Under this subsection, the bidder under a takeover bid may 
compulsorily acquire any securities in the bid class if:
(a) the bid is:
(i) an off-market bid to acquire all the securities in the bid 
class; or
(ii) a market bid; and
(b) during, or at the end of, the offer period:
(i) the bidder and their associates have relevant interests in 
at least 90% (by number) of the securities in the bid 
class; and
(ii) the bidder and their associates have acquired at least

Part 6.10  Review and intervention
Division 1—Compulsory acquisition of bid class securities
75% (by number) of the securities that the bidder

offered to acquire under the bid (whether the 
acquisitions happened under the bid or otherwise).
This is so even if the bidder subsequently ceases to satisfy 
subparagraph (b)(i) because of the issue of further securities in the 
bid class.
Note: Subsection 92(3) defines securities for the purposes of this Chapter.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), disregard any relevant interests 
that the bidder has merely because of the operation of 
subsection 608(3) (relevant interest by 20% interest in body 
corporate).
