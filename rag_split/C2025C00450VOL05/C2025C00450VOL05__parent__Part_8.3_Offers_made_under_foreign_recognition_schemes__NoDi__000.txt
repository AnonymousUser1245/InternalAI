1200U  ASIC stop order for advertising in a recognised jurisdiction

(1) If ASIC is satisfied that:
(a) an offer of securities is being made or has been made in a 
recognised jurisdiction under a foreign recognition scheme; 
and
(b) there is a contravention of section 734 or 1018A (as they 
apply by force of section 1200T) constituted by conduct in 
the recognised jurisdiction in relation to the offer;
ASIC may order that no offers, issues, sales or transfers of the 
securities the subject of the offer be made in the recognised 
jurisdiction while the order is in force.
(2) Before making an order under subsection (1), ASIC must:
(a) hold a hearing; and
(b) give a reasonable opportunity to any interested people to 
make oral or written submissions to ASIC on whether an 
order should be made.
(3) If ASIC considers that any delay in making an order under 
subsection (1) pending the holding of a hearing would be 
prejudicial to the public interest, ASIC may make an interim order 
that no offers, issues, sales or transfers of the securities be made 
while the interim order is in force. The interim order may be made 
without holding a hearing and lasts for 21 days after the day on 
which it is made unless revoked before then.
(4) At any time during the hearing, ASIC may make an interim order 
that no offers, issues, sales or transfers of the securities be made 
while the interim order is in force. The interim order lasts until:
