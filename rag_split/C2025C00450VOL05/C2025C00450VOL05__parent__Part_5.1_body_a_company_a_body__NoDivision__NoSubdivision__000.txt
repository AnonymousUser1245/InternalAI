Note: For item 2—for example, the draft explanatory statement provided for 
in subsection 411(2) must state any material interests of the corporate 
director and of the directors of the corporate director.
(5) Despite item 1 of the table in subsection (4), a reference covered 
by column 1 of that item is taken to be a reference to the CCIV if 
the context of the reference so requires (for example, because the 
reference requires the legal capacity and powers of a company).
Note 1: For example, references to the Part 5.1 body, in the context of the 
body as a party to a compromise or arrangement, are references to the 
CCIV, because the CCIV is the legal person that is a party to, and that 
is bound by, the compromise or arrangement.
Note 2: For example, references to the Part 5.1 body, in the context of 
identifying a liquidator, are references to the sub-fund, because 
winding up of a CCIV takes place at the sub-fund level.
(6) If a reference in a provision to the relevant body is, as a result of 
subsection (5), taken to be a reference to the CCIV, the operation 
of the provision in relation to the CCIV is confined, to the extent 
possible, to the sub-fund.
