1072A  Transmission of shares on death (replaceable rule—see

section 135)
If shares not held jointly
(1) If a shareholder who does not own shares jointly dies, the company 
will recognise only the personal representative of the deceased 
shareholder as being entitled to the deceased shareholder’s interest 
in the shares.
(2) If the personal representative gives the directors the information 
they reasonably require to establish the representative’s entitlement 
to be registered as holder of the shares:
(a) the personal representative may:
(i) by giving a written and signed notice to the company, 
elect to be registered as the holder of the shares; or
(ii) by giving a completed transfer form to the company, 
transfer the shares to another person; and
(b) the personal representative is entitled, whether or not 
registered as the holder of the shares, to the same rights as 
the deceased shareholder.
(3) On receiving an election under subparagraph (2)(a)(i), the 
company must register the personal representative as the holder of 
the shares.
(4) A transfer under subparagraph (2)(a)(ii) is subject to the same rules 
(for example, about entitlement to transfer and registration of 
transfers) as apply to transfers generally.
