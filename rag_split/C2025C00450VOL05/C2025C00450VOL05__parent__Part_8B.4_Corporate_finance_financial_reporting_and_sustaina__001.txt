sub-funds with ED securities on issue
(1) Section 302 does not apply to a CCIV that is a disclosing entity 
except as set out in this section.
(2) If any securities referable to a sub-fund of a retail CCIV are ED 
securities, section 302 applies to the CCIV as if the requirement in 
paragraph 302(a) required the CCIV to prepare a financial report 
and directors’ report for each half-year for the sub-fund.
Note: For ED securities in a CCIV, see subsection 111AF(3), and 
section 111AI as affected by section 1231P.
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), ED securities that are units of 
shares in a CCIV are referable to the sub-fund of the CCIV to 
which the shares are referable.
(4) The remaining provisions of Division 2 of Part 2M.3 apply in 
relation to the following documents relating to the sub-fund:
(a) a financial report and directors’ report prepared under 
paragraph 302(a) as applied by subsection (2) of this section;
(b) the documents of which the financial report consists under 
subsection 303(1);
as if the sub-fund were the CCIV.
Note: The combined effect of subsection 1232(1) and this subsection is that 
references in the remaining provisions of Division 2 of Part 2M.3 to 
the disclosing entity are, where appropriate, to be read as referring to 
the sub-fund.
(5) Despite subsection (4) of this section, paragraph 303(4)(c) applies 
to a directors’ declaration relating to the sub-fund as if the debts 
mentioned in that paragraph were only the debts referable to the 
sub-fund.
