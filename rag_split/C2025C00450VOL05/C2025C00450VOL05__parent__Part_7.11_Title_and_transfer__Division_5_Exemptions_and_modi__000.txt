1075A  ASIC’s power to exempt and modify

(1) ASIC may:
(a) exempt specified financial products, or a specified class of 
financial products, from a provision of this Part; or
(b) declare that this Part applies to specified financial products, 
or a specified class of financial products, as if specified 
provisions were omitted, modified or varied as specified in 
the declaration.
(2) ASIC’s power to grant an exemption or make a declaration under 
this section may be exercised in relation to financial products, or a 
class of financial products, only if ASIC is satisfied that:
(a) if the exemption were granted or the declaration were made, 
the interests of the holders of those financial products, or of 
financial products in that class, would continue to have 
adequate protection; and
(b) the granting of the exemption or the making of the 
declaration would make the transfer of those financial 
products, or of financial products in that class, more efficient.
(3) The exemption or declaration may:
(a) apply to all or specified provisions of this Part; and
(b) apply to all persons, specified persons, or a specified class of 
persons; and
(c) relate to all financial products, specified financial products or 
a specified class of financial products; and
(d) relate to any other matter generally or as specified.
(4) An exemption may apply unconditionally or subject to specified 
conditions. A person to whom a condition specified in an 
exemption applies must comply with the condition. The Court may 
order the person to comply with the condition in a specified way. 
Only ASIC may apply to the Court for the order.

publish notice of it in the Gazette.
(6) If conduct (including an omission) of a person would not have 
constituted an offence if a particular declaration under

subsection (5)):
(a) the text of the declaration was made available by ASIC on 
the internet; or
(b) ASIC gave written notice setting out the text of the
