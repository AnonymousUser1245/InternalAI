Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Disclosure Statement to be included in the Product Disclosure 
Statement it supplements).
disclosure document or statement means:
(a) a Product Disclosure Statement; or
(b) a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement; or
(c) information required by paragraph 1012G(3)(a); or
(d) an offer document of a kind referred to in section 1019E; or
(e) a supplementary offer document of a kind referred to in 
section 1019J.
(1A) For the avoidance of doubt, if section 1012J (information must be 
up to date) is not complied with in relation to a Product Disclosure 
Statement, then, for the purposes of the definition of defective in 
subsection (1):
(a) if the circumstance constituting the non-compliance is that 
particular information included in the Product Disclosure 
Statement is not as up to date as section 1012J requires it to 
be—the information so included constitutes a misleading 
statement in the Product Disclosure Statement; and
(b) if the circumstance constituting the non-compliance is a 
failure to include particular information that was not 
previously required to be included in the Product Disclosure 
Statement—the failure to include the information constitutes 
an omission from the Statement of material required by 
section 1013C.
Note: The effect of section 1014D (information in a Supplementary Product 
Disclosure Statement is taken to be contained in the Product 
Disclosure Statement it supplements) must be taken into account in 
determining whether section 1012J is complied with in relation to a 
Product Disclosure Statement.
(2) In this Subdivision, a reference (including in the definitions in 
subsection (1)) to a document or statement, or to information, of a 
kind referred to in a paragraph of the definition of disclosure 
document or statement in subsection (1) includes a reference to 
something purporting to be a document or statement, or to be 
information, of that kind.
