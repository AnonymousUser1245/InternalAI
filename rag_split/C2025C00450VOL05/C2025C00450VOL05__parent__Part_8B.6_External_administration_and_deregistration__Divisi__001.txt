Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/20251239E  The Commonwealth’s and ASIC’s power to fulfil outstanding 
obligations in relation to deregistered sub-fund
The Commonwealth or ASIC may do an act on behalf of the CCIV 
of a deregistered sub-fund or the liquidator of the sub-fund if the 
Commonwealth or ASIC is satisfied that the CCIV or liquidator 
would be bound to do the act if the sub-fund had not been 
deregistered.
Note: This power is a general one and is not limited to acts in relation to 
property vested in the Commonwealth under subsection 601AD(1A), 
or ASIC under subsection 601AD(2). The Commonwealth or ASIC 
has all the powers that automatically flow from the vesting of property 
under that subsection (see subsections 601AD(3A) and (4)) and may 
exercise those powers whether or not the CCIV was bound to do so.
