Part 2M.3 applies in relation to a sub-fund of a retail CCIV, and in

relation to the following documents relating to the sub-fund:
(a) a financial report prepared as described in 
subsection 1232C(1);
(aa) a sustainability report prepared as described in 
subsection 1232C(1);
(b) a financial report prepared as described in section 1232F;
as if the sub-fund were the CCIV.

Note: The combined effect of subsection 1232(1) and this subsection is that 
references in the remaining provisions of Division 3 of Part 2M.3 to 
the company are, where appropriate, to be read as referring to the 
sub-fund.

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), Division 3 of Part 2M.3 so applies 
as if:
(a) references in that Division to members (other than references 
to members of an audit firm) were instead references to 
members of the sub-fund; and
(b) references in that Division to an officer included references 
to an officer of the corporate director of the CCIV.
