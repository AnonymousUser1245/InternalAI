186 Corporations Act 2001

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(5) If:
(a) paragraph (1)(c) (other than subparagraph (1)(c)(ia) or (ib)) 
applies; and
(b) an alteration was made to the disclosure document or 
statement (not being information required by 
paragraph 1012G(3)(a)) before it was given to the client; and
(c) the alteration made the disclosure document or statement 
defective, or more defective than it would otherwise have 
been; and
(d) the alteration was not made by, or with the authority of, the 
person who would, but for this subsection, be a liable person 
because of subparagraph (3)(b)(i);
then, so far as a person has suffered loss or damage because the 
disclosure document or statement was defective because of the 
alteration, the person who made the alteration is a liable person, 
rather than the person referred to in paragraph (d).
(5A) If:
(a) paragraph (3)(aa) applies; and
(b) the person referred to in that paragraph is not the issuer, or an 
authorised representative of the issuer, of the financial 
product to which the required disclosure document or 
statement relates; and
(c) the required disclosure document or statement was defective 
because of information, or an omission from information, 
provided to that person (whether in a document or otherwise) 
by the issuer of the product;
the issuer of the product is the liable person, rather than the person 
who would otherwise be the liable person because of 
paragraph (3)(aa) or subsection (4).
(6) An action under subsection (2) may be begun at any time within 6 
years after the day on which the cause of action arose.
(7) A person is not liable under subsection (2) in a situation described 
in paragraph (1)(c) if the person took reasonable steps to ensure 
that the disclosure document or statement would not be defective.
