when it was prepared, or that it became or has become 
defective as at some later time.
Note: Information and statements in a Supplementary Product Disclosure 
Statement are taken to be contained in the Product Disclosure 
Statement it supplements (see section 1014D).
(2) If this section applies, the responsible person must, in relation to 
any application for financial products of the relevant kind that is 
made in response to the Product Disclosure Statement (the first 
Product Disclosure Statement) and that has not resulted in an issue 
or sale of financial products of that kind, comply with one of the 
following paragraphs:
(a) the responsible person must repay the money they received 
from the applicant; or
(aa) the responsible person must give the applicant:
(i) a new Product Disclosure Statement for the financial 
products, and an additional statement that identifies the 
respects in which the new Product Disclosure Statement 
is materially different from the first Product Disclosure 
Statement; and
(ii) 1 month to withdraw their application and be repaid; or
(b) the responsible person must give the applicant:

or
(c) the responsible person must issue or sell the financial 
products to the applicant and give them:
(i) a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement that 
changes the statement referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or 
(b), or that corrects the deficiency referred to in 
paragraph (1)(c); and
(ii) 1 month to return the financial products and be repaid.
Note 1: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see 
subsection 1311(1)).
Note 2: If the responsible person chooses the option given by paragraph (aa) 
or (b), that option does not require the responsible person to wait until 
the end of the month referred to in subparagraph (aa)(ii) or (b)(ii) 
before going ahead and issuing or selling the financial products to the 
applicant if the applicant indicates before then that they still wish to 
proceed with the application.
Note 3: However, if the responsible person chooses the option given by 
paragraph (aa) or (b), whether the responsible person may go ahead 
and issue or sell the financial products to the applicant at the end of 
the month referred to in subparagraph (aa)(ii) or (b)(ii) (or earlier, as 
mentioned in note 2) is affected by this subsection and sections 1016A 
to 1016E (including as those provisions are affected by 
subsections (2A) and (2B) of this section).
Note 4: If the responsible person chooses the option given by paragraph (c), 
sections 1016A to 1016D do not prohibit the issue or sale of the 
financial products under that paragraph (see subsection (2C) of this 
section).
(2A) If, in accordance with paragraph (2)(aa), the responsible person 
gives the applicant a new Product Disclosure Statement for the 
financial products and the additional statement referred to in 
subparagraph (2)(aa)(i):
(a) subsection (2), and sections 1016B, 1016C, 1016D and

Part 7.9  Financial product disclosure and other provisions relating to issue, sale and
Division 2  Product Disclosure Statements
1016E, apply in relation to the application, from the time

when the applicant is given the new Product Disclosure 
Statement (the correction time), as if the application had 
been made in response to the new Product Disclosure 
Statement; and

78 Corporations Act 2001

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(b) if:
(i) the reason for giving the new Product Disclosure 
Statement was that the responsible person became 
aware that the first Product Disclosure Statement was 
defective as at the time when it was prepared, or had 
become defective by the time the application was made; 
and
(ii) the financial products are relevant financial products as 
defined in section 1016A;
section 1016A applies in relation to the application, from the 
correction time, as if the first Product Disclosure Statement 
had instead contained the content of the new Product 
Disclosure Statement.
Note 1: Because of paragraph (a):
(a) if this section applies to the new Product Disclosure Statement, 
the responsible personâ€™s ability to proceed to issue or sell the 
financial products pursuant to the application will be affected by 
subsection (2), and by sections 1016B, 1016C and 1016D, as 
those provisions apply in relation to the new Product Disclosure 
Statement (even though the application was actually made in 
response to the first Product Disclosure Statement); and
(b) sections 1016B, 1016C and 1016D, as they relate to the first 
Product Disclosure Statement, cease to apply in relation to the 
application.
Note 2: Because of paragraph (b), the application may be an eligible 
application as defined in section 1016A, even though the first Product 
Disclosure Statement was actually defective as at the time when the 
application was made.
(2B) If:
(a) in accordance with paragraph (2)(b), the responsible person 
gives the applicant a Supplementary Product Disclosure 
Statement that relates to the financial products; and
(b) the reason for giving the Supplementary Product Disclosure 
Statement was that the responsible person became aware that 
the first Product Disclosure Statement was defective as at the 
time when it was prepared, or had become defective by the 
time the application was made; and
