Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(d) on the application of a person aggrieved by an alleged 
contravention by another person of subsection 798H(1) 
(complying with market integrity rules) or 981M(1) 
(complying with client money reporting rules) or a provision 
of the operating rules, or the compensation rules (if any), of a 
licensed market, or subsection 908CF(1) (complying with 
rules about financial benchmarks), it appears to the Court 
that:
(i) the other person did contravene the provision; and
(ii) the applicant is aggrieved by the contravention.
However, the Court can only make such an order if the Court is 
satisfied that the order would not unfairly prejudice any person.
Note: For examples of orders the Court could make, see subsection (4).
(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), if a body corporate 
contravenes a provision of the operating rules of a licensed market, 
a person who holds financial products of the body corporate that 
are able to be traded on the licensed market is taken to be a person 
aggrieved by the contravention.
(3) Subsection (2) does not limit the circumstances in which a person 
may be aggrieved by a contravention for the purposes of 
paragraph (1)(d).
Examples of orders the Court may make
(4) Without limiting subsection (1), some examples of orders the Court 
may make under subsection (1) include:
(a) an order restraining a person from carrying on a business, or 
doing an act or classes of acts, in relation to financial 
products or financial services, if the person has persistently 
contravened, or is continuing to contravene:
(i) a provision or provisions of this Chapter; or
(ii) a provision or provisions of any other law relating to 
dealing in financial products or providing financial 
services; or
(iii) a condition on an Australian market licence, Australian 
CS facility licence, Australian derivative trade
