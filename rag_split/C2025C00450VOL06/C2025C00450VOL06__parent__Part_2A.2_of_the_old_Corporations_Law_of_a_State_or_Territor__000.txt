Part 2A.2 of the old Corporations Law of a State or Territory
Section 1378

Corporations Act 2001 267
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(3) The application of subsection (1) in relation to the registration of a 
company does not have the effect of creating that company as a 
new legal entity. Rather, it has the effect of continuing the 
existence of the legal entity that is that company with the same 
characteristics and attributes as it had immediately before the 
commencement. The date of the companyâ€™s first registration 
remains the same (see subsection 1402(2)), and a new certificate of 
registration does not need to be issued.
Note: The company will, for example, retain the same name, ACN, 
constitution and registered office as it had immediately before the 
commencement. Its certificate of registration will (because of 
section 1399) have effect as if it were issued under section 118 of this 
Act.
(4) The State or Territory in which the company is taken to be 
registered is the State or Territory under whose old Corporations 
Law the company was registered immediately before 
commencement. This subsection has effect subject to 
subsection 119A(3).
Note: For the general provisions about jurisdiction of incorporation and 
jurisdiction of registration, see section 119A.
