1318  Power to grant relief

(1) If, in any civil proceeding against a person to whom this section 
applies for negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of duty in 
a capacity as such a person, it appears to the court before which the 
proceedings are taken that the person is or may be liable in respect 
of the negligence, default or breach but that the person has acted 
honestly and that, having regard to all the circumstances of the 
case, including those connected with the person’s appointment, the 
person ought fairly to be excused for the negligence, default or 
breach, the court may relieve the person either wholly or partly 
from liability on such terms as the court thinks fit.
(2) Where a person to whom this section applies has reason to 
apprehend that any claim will or might be made against the person 
in respect of any negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of 
duty in a capacity as such a person, the person may apply to the 
Court for relief, and the Court has the same power to relieve the 
person as it would have had under subsection (1) if it had been a 
court before which proceedings against the person for negligence, 
default, breach of trust or breach of duty had been brought.
(3) Where a case to which subsection (1) applies is being tried by a 
judge with a jury, the judge after hearing the evidence may, if he or 
she is satisfied that the defendant ought pursuant to that subsection 
to be relieved either wholly or partly from the liability sought to be 
enforced against the person, withdraw the case in whole or in part 
from the jury and forthwith direct judgment to be entered for the 
defendant on such terms as to costs or otherwise as the judge thinks 
proper.
(4) This section applies to a person who is:
(a) an officer or employee of a corporation; or
