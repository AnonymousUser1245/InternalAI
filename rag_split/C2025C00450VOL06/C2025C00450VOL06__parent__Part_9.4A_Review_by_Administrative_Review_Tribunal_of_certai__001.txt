Corporations Act 2001 115
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(3) Subsection (2) does not require the decision maker to give notice to 
a person affected by the decision or to the persons in a class of 
persons affected by the decision, if the decision maker determines 
that giving notice to the person or persons is not warranted, having 
regard to:
(a) the cost of giving notice to the person or persons; and
(b) the way in which the interests of the person or persons are 
affected by the decision.
(4) A failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of 
the decision.
(5) The fact that a person has not been given notice of the decision 
because of a determination under subsection (3) constitutes special 
circumstances for the purposes of subsection 20(2) of the 
Administrative Review Tribunal Act 2024.
(6) To avoid doubt, this section, instead of section 266 of the 
Administrative Review Tribunal Act 2024, applies to the 
requirement to give notice of the making of a decision to which 
section 1317B of this Act applies.
