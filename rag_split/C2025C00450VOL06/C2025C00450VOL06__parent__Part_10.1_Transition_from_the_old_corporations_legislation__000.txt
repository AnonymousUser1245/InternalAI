Division 7  Regulations dealing with transitional matters
1409  Regulations may deal with transitional matters

(1) The regulations may deal with matters of a transitional nature 
relating to the transition from the application of provisions of the 
old corporations legislation of the States and Territories in this 
jurisdiction to the application of provisions of the new corporations 
legislation. The regulations have effect despite anything else in this 
Part, other than section 1375.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations may provide for a 
matter to be dealt with, wholly or partly, in any of the following 
ways:
(a) by applying (with or without modifications) to the matter:
(i) provisions of the old corporations legislation of the 
States and Territories in this jurisdiction, as in force 
immediately before the commencement or at some 
earlier time; or
(ii) provisions of the new corporations legislation; or
(iii) a combination of provisions referred to in 
subparagraphs (i) and (ii);
(b) by otherwise specifying rules for dealing with the matter;
(c) by specifying a particular consequence of the matter, or of an 
outcome of the matter, for the purposes of the new 
corporations legislation.
(3) The regulations may provide that certain provisions of this Part are 
taken to be modified as set out in the regulations. Those provisions 
then have effect as if they were so modified.
(4) Despite subsection 12(2) of the Legislation Act 2003, regulations 
for the purposes of this section may be expressed to take effect 
from a date before the regulations are registered under that Act.
