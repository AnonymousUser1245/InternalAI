Amendment (Takeovers) Act 2007 apply in relation to an 
application under section 657C (including any review under 
section 657EA of the decision made on the application) if:
(a) the application under section 657C is made on or after the 
commencement of that Schedule; or
(b) the application under section 657C was made before the 
commencement of that Schedule but the Panel has not finally 
disposed of the application before the commencement of that

For the purposes of paragraph (b), the Panel does not finally 
dispose of an application under section 657C until the Panel has 
disposed of any review under section 657EA of the decision made 
on the application.
(2) To avoid doubt, the amendments apply in relation to the 
application even if the circumstances to which the application 
relates arose before the commencement of Schedule 1 to the 
Corporations Amendment (Takeovers) Act 2007.
