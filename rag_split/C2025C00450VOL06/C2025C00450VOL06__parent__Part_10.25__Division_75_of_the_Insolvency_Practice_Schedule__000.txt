Part 10.25
Division 75 of the Insolvency Practice Schedule (Corporations)

rather than the old Act would apply to a meeting that deals with the 
remuneration of an external administrator of a company who is 
appointed before the commencement day, Division 75 of the 
Insolvency Practice Schedule (Corporations) applies to that 
meeting.

Part 10.25
Division 75 of the Insolvency Practice Schedule (Corporations)
1582  Duties of administrators relating to remuneration and other

benefits
(1) Section 60-20 of the Insolvency Practice Schedule (Corporations) 
applies in relation to an external administrator of an ongoing 
external administration of a company whether or not the 
administrator was appointed before, on or after the commencement 
day.
(2) However, that section does not apply in relation to arrangements 
made before the commencement day.

Part 10.25
Division 75 of the Insolvency Practice Schedule (Corporations)
1583  Old Act continues to apply in relation to any right of indemnity

(1) This section applies if the remuneration of an external 
administrator of a company is fixed under section 449E of the old 
Act:
(a) before the commencement day; or
(b) on or after the commencement day (in accordance with a 
provision of this Division).
(2) Despite the repeal of that section and the amendment of 
paragraph 443D(b) of the old Act by Schedule 2 to the Insolvency 
Law Reform Act 2016, the old Act continues to apply in relation to 
any right of indemnity that the external administrator has as if that 
repeal and amendment had not happened.
