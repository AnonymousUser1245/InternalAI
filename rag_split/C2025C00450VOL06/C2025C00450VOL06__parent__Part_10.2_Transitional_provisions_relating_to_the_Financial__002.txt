granted under subsection 1425(2) in relation to the 
facility, and the conditions subject to which it is 
granted, to be taken to have had effect from the day (the 
start day) specified in the subsection (3) notice as the 
day on which the facility started to operate; and
(iii) as if subsection 1425(6) were omitted; and
(iv) as if the references in subsection 1425(8) to the FSR 
commencement were instead references to the start day;
(c) if:
(i) taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), 
section 1429 applies to the proposed facility; and
(ii) the facility operator does not lodge with ASIC a notice 
in relation to the facility under subsection (3) of this 
section by the end of 6 months after the FSR 
commencement;
that section ceases to apply in relation to the proposed facility 
at the end of that period;
(d) if a provision of this Subdivision provides for a provision of 
the old Corporations Act to continue to apply in relation to 
the proposed facility, then (without limiting the generality of 
subsection 1410(3)), while the proposed facility remains 
non-operational, the provision of the old Corporations Act 
only applies in relation to the proposed facility to the extent 
(if any) to which it would, disregarding the effect of 
paragraph (a), apply in relation to the proposed facility.
(3) If a proposed clearing and settlement facility to which this section 
applies starts to operate on a day during the period of 6 months 
starting on the FSR commencement, the operator must, as soon as 
practicable, and in any event within 7 days, lodge with ASIC 
written notice of the fact that the facility started to operate on that 
day.
Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see 
subsection 1311(1)).
