Section 1299M

Corporations Act 2001 59
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/20251299M  Effect of cancellation
If a company’s registration as an authorised audit company is 
cancelled (whether under section 1299H or 1299I), each 
appointment of the company as auditor for a company or registered 
scheme for the purposes of this Act that is in force on the day on 
which the cancellation decision takes effect is terminated at the end 
of that day.
Note: This means that the authorised audit company ceases to be auditor 
without resigning and that the position of auditor for the company or 
scheme will immediately become vacant unless there is another 
auditor who has been appointed, and who can continue to act, as 
auditor for the company or registered scheme.
