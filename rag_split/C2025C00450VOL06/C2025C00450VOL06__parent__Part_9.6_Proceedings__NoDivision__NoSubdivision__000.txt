Act; or
(c) an act or omission was unlawful by virtue of a provision of 
this Act; or
(d) a person has been in any way, by act or omission, directly or 
indirectly, knowingly concerned in or party to a 
contravention, or a default in complying with, a provision of

For the purposes of this Act, a certificate that:
(a) purports to be signed by the Registrar or other proper officer 
of an Australian court; and
(b) states:
(i) that a person was convicted by that court on a specified 
day of a specified offence; or
(ii) that a person charged before that court with a specified 
offence was, on a specified day, found in that court to 
have committed the offence but that the court did not 
proceed to convict the person of the offence;

of the offence on that day; and

provision of a law—that the person contravened that 
provision.

given for those costs and stay all proceedings until the security is 
given.

(2) The costs of any proceeding before a court under this Act are to be 
borne by such party to the proceeding as the court, in its discretion, 
directs.
