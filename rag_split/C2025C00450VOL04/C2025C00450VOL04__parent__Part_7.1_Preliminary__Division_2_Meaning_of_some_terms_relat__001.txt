(iii) an index;
(iv) a commodity.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), anything declared by the 
regulations to be a derivative is a derivative. A thing so declared is 
a derivative despite anything in subsections (3) and (4).
(3) Subject to subsection (2), none of the following is a derivative even 
if covered by subsection (1):
(a) an arrangement in relation to which subparagraphs (i), (ii) 
and (iii) are satisfied:
(i) a party has, or may have, an obligation to buy, and 
another party has, or may have, an obligation to sell, 
tangible property (other than Australian or foreign 
currency) at a price and on a date in the future; and
(ii) the arrangement does not permit the seller’s obligations 
to be wholly settled by cash, or by set-off between the 
parties, rather than by delivery of the property; and
(iii) neither usual market practice, nor the rules of a licensed 
market or a licensed CS facility, permits the seller’s 
obligations to be closed out by the matching up of the 
arrangement with another arrangement of the same kind 
under which the seller has offsetting obligations to buy;
but only to the extent that the arrangement deals with that 
purchase and sale;
(b) a contract for the future provision of services;
(c) anything that is covered by a paragraph of 
subsection 764A(1), other than paragraph (c) of that 
subsection;
(d) anything declared by the regulations not to be a derivative.
(4) Subject to subsection (2), an arrangement under which one party 
has an obligation to buy, and the other has an obligation to sell, 
property is not a derivative merely because the arrangement 
provides for the consideration to be varied by reference to a 
general inflation index such as the Consumer Price Index.
