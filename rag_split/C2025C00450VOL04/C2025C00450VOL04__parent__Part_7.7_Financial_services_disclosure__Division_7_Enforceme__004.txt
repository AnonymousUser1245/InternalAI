Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(b) if the person first-referred to in paragraph (1)(a), (b), (ba) or 
(c) is an authorised representative of only one financial 
services licensee—that financial services licensee; or
(c) if the person first-referred to in paragraph (1)(a), (b), (ba) or 
(c) is an authorised representative of more than one financial 
services licensee:
(i) if, under the rules in section 917C, one of those 
licensees is responsible for the person’s conduct—that 
licensee; or
(ii) if, under the rules in section 917C, 2 or more of those 
licensees are jointly and severally responsible for the

(a) paragraph (1)(b) or (ba) applies; and
(b) an alteration was made to the disclosure document or

years after the day on which the cause of action arose.
(6) A person is not liable under subsection (2) in a situation described
