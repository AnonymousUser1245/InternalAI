798E  Other potential conflict situations

(1) The regulations may make provision in relation to the rules and 
procedures that are to apply in the case of conflicts, or potential 
conflicts, between the commercial interests of the licensee and the 
need for the licensee to ensure that the market operates in the way 
mentioned in paragraph 792A(1)(a).

(a) identifying when such a conflict, or potential conflict, is 
taken to arise;
(b) empowering ASIC, instead of the licensee, to make decisions 
and to take action under the market’s operating rules in 
relation to such a conflict or potential conflict;
(c) empowering ASIC to require the licensee to take action 
under the market’s operating rules (whether or not on ASIC’s 
behalf) in relation to such a conflict or potential conflict.
Note: For fees in respect of ASIC performing this function, see Part 9.10.
(3) Subsection (2) does not limit the generality of subsection (1).
