that make up the Financial Services Guide.
(3) If there are or may be different versions of a document referred to 
in paragraph (2)(b), the statement required by subsection (2) does 
not have to identify any particular one of those versions and may 
instead identify the document generically.
Note: For example, if a Financial Services Guide is made up of a core 
document that is not updated very frequently, and a separate document 
providing information about remuneration that is updated more 
frequently:
(a) the statement in the core document need only refer to the fact that 
it, and a separate document about remuneration, make up the 
Financial Services Guide; and
(b) the statement in the document about remuneration need only 
refer to the fact that it, and a separate document about all other 
required matters, make up the Financial Services Guide.
(4) The requirement of section 942A (title of Financial Services 
Guide) is taken to be satisfied if the title “Financial Services 
Guide” is used on the cover of, or at or near the front of, at least 
one of the documents that make up the Financial Services Guide.
(5) The requirement of subsection 942B(5) or 942C(5) (dating of 
Financial Services Guide) must be separately complied with in 
relation to each of the documents. If, for any purpose, a single date 
needs to be determined as the date of the Financial Services Guide 
as a whole, that date is the most recent of the dates of those 
documents.
(6) Section 942E applies to an alteration to one of the documents as 
though the reference in that section to the date specified in the 
Financial Services Guide were a reference to the date specified in 
the document.
(7) The regulations may impose additional requirements to be 
complied with if a Financial Services Guide is made up of 2 or 
more documents.
