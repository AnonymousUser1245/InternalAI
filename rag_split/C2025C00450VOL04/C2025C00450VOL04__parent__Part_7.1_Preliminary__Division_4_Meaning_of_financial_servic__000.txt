Provision of traditional trustee company services by trustee

(1A) Subject to paragraph (2)(b), the provision by a trustee company of 
a traditional trustee company service constitutes the provision, by 
the company, of a financial service.
Note: Trustee companies may also provide other kinds of financial service 
mentioned in subsection (1).
(1B) The regulations may, in relation to a traditional trustee company 
service of a particular class, prescribe the person or persons to 
whom a service of that class is taken to be provided. This

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Regulations may deal with various matters
(2) The regulations may set out:
(a) the circumstances in which persons facilitating the provision 
of a financial service (for example, by publishing 
information) are taken also to provide that service; or
(b) the circumstances in which persons are taken to provide, or 
are taken not to provide, a financial service.
Exception for work ordinarily done by clerks or cashiers
(3) To avoid doubt, a person’s conduct is not the provision of a 
financial service if it is done in the course of work of a kind 
ordinarily done by clerks or cashiers.
Meaning of operating a registered scheme
(4) For the purposes of this section, a person is not operating a 
registered scheme merely because:
(a) they are acting as an agent or employee of another person; or
(b) they are taking steps to wind up the scheme.
Overlap between financial services
(5) The fact that conduct constitutes the provision of a financial 
service is not to be taken to imply that the conduct does not also 
constitute the provision of another financial service.
Note: For example, conduct may constitute providing a superannuation 
trustee service and also providing another financial service (such as 
dealing in a financial product that is a superannuation product).

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025of financial products, or an interest in a particular financial 
product or class of financial products; or
(b) could reasonably be regarded as being intended to have such 
an influence.
(1A) However, subject to subsection (1B), the provision or giving of an 
exempt document or statement does not constitute the provision of 
financial product advice.
(1B) Subsection (1A) does not apply for the purpose of determining 
whether a recommendation or statement of opinion made by an 
outside expert, or a report of such a recommendation or statement 
of opinion, that is included in an exempt document or statement is 
financial product advice provided by the outside expert.
(2) There are 2 types of financial product advice: personal advice and 
general advice.
(3)Personal advice is financial product advice that is given or directed 
to a person (including by electronic means) in circumstances 
where:
(a) the provider of the advice has considered one or more of the 
person’s objectives, financial situation and needs (otherwise 
than for the purposes of compliance with the Anti-Money 
Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 or 
with regulations, or AML/CTF Rules, under that Act); or
(b) a reasonable person might expect the provider to have 
considered one or more of those matters.
(3A) However, the acts of asking for information solely to determine 
whether a person is in a target market for a financial product, and 
of informing the person of the result of that determination, do not, 
of themselves, constitute personal advice.
(4)General advice is financial product advice that is not personal 
advice.
(5) The following advice is not financial product advice:

Corporations Act 2001 43
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(a) advice given by a lawyer in his or her professional capacity, 
about matters of law, legal interpretation or the application of 
the law to any facts;
(b) except as may be prescribed by the regulations—any other 
advice given by a lawyer in the ordinary course of activities 
as a lawyer, that is reasonably regarded as a necessary part of 
those activities;
(c) except as may be prescribed by the regulations—advice 
given by a registered tax agent or BAS agent, that is given in 
the ordinary course of activities as such an agent and that is 
reasonably regarded as a necessary part of those activities.
(6) If:
(a) in response to a request made by a person (the inquirer) to 
another person (the provider), the provider tells the inquirer 
the cost, or an estimate of the likely cost, of a financial 
product (for example, an insurance product); and
(b) that cost or estimate is worked out, or said by the provider to 
be worked out, by reference to a valuation of an item (for 
example, a house or car to which an insurance policy would 
relate), being a valuation that the provider suggests or 
recommends to the inquirer;
the acts of telling the inquirer the cost, or estimated cost, and 
suggesting or recommending the valuation, do not, of themselves, 
constitute the making of a recommendation (or the provision of any 
other kind of financial product advice) relating to the financial 
product.
(7) If:
(a) in response to a request made by a person (the inquirer) to 
another person (the provider), the provider tells the inquirer 
information about:
(i) the cost of a financial product; or
(ii) the rate of return on a financial product; or
(iii) any other matter identified in regulations made for the 
purposes of this subparagraph; and
