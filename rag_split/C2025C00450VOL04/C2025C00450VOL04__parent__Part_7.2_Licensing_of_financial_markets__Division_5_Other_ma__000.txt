Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Note: There are certain matters that must be included in the market’s listing 
rules before such an entity, scheme or fund is included in the official 
list (see subsection (4)).
(2) In such a case, the financial products of the listed entity may be 
traded on the market, if either or both the listed entity and the 
market licensee have entered into such arrangements as ASIC 
requires:
(a) for dealing with possible conflicts of interest that might arise 
from the listed entity’s financial products being able to be 
traded on the market; and
(b) for the purposes of ensuring the integrity of trading in the 
listed entity’s financial products.
Note: For fees in respect of ASIC performing functions under such 
arrangements, see Part 9.10.
(3) The listed entity, and the market licensee (if applicable), with 
whom ASIC has entered into arrangements for the purposes of 
subsection (2) must comply with the arrangements.
Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see 
subsection 1311(1)).
(4) Before, and at all times while, the listed entity is included in the 
market’s official list, the market’s listing rules must provide for 
ASIC, instead of the market licensee, to make decisions and to take 
action (or to require the market licensee to take action on ASIC’s 
behalf) in relation to these matters, and matters related to these 
matters:
(a) the admission of the listed entity to the market’s official list; 
and
(b) the removal of the listed entity from that list; and
(c) allowing, stopping or suspending the trading on the market of 
the listed entity’s financial products.
Note: For fees in respect of ASIC performing this function, see Part 9.10.
(5) ASIC has the powers and functions that are provided for it in any 
listing rules or arrangements made for the purposes of this section.
