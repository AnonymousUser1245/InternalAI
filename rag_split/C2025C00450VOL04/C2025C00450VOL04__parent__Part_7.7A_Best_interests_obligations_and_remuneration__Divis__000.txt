Subdivision A—Volume-based shelf-space fees

964A  Platform operator must not accept volume-based shelf-space

fees
(1) The platform operator must not accept the benefit if it is a 
volume-based shelf-space fee.
Note: This subsection is a civil penalty provision (see section 1317E).
(2) Subject to subsection (3), the benefit is presumed to be a 
volume-based shelf-space fee if the benefit, or the value of benefit, 
is wholly or partly dependent on the total number or value of the 
funds manager’s financial products of a particular class, or 
particular classes, to which the custodial arrangement relates.
(3) If it is proved that all or part of the benefit is of a kind specified in 
one of the following paragraphs then, to the extent that the benefit 
is of that kind, it is not presumed to be a volume-based shelf space 
fee:
(a) a reasonable fee for a service provided to the funds manager 
by the platform operator or another person;
(b) a discount on an amount payable, or a rebate of an amount 
paid, to the funds manager by the platform operator, the 
value of which does not exceed an amount that may 
reasonably be attributed to efficiencies gained by the funds 
manager because of the number or value of financial products 
in relation to which the funds manager provides services to 
the platform operator, or through the platform operator to 
another person.
