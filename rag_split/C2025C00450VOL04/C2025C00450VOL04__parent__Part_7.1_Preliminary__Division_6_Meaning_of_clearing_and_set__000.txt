Division 6  Meaning of clearing and settlement facility
768A  Meaning of clearing and settlement facility

(1) A clearing and settlement facility is a facility that provides a 
regular mechanism for the parties to transactions relating to 
financial products to meet obligations to each other that:
(a) arise from entering into the transactions; and
(b) are of a kind prescribed by regulations made for the purposes 
of this paragraph.
Example 1: A facility that provides a regular mechanism for stockbrokers to pay 
for the shares they buy and to be paid for the shares they sell, and for 
records of those transactions to be processed to facilitate registration 
of the new ownership of the shares, would be a clearing and 
settlement facility (assuming that the relevant obligations are of a kind 
prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of this section).
Example 2: A facility that provides a regular mechanism for registering trade in 
derivatives on a futures market and that enables the calculation of 
payments that market participants owe by way of margins would also 
be a clearing and settlement facility (assuming that the relevant 
obligations are of a kind prescribed by regulations made for the 
purposes of this section).
(2) However, the following conduct does not constitute operating a 
clearing and settlement facility:
(a) an ADI (within the meaning of the Banking Act 1959) acting 
in the ordinary course of its banking business;
(b) a person acting on their own behalf, or on behalf of one party 
to a transaction only;
(c) a person who provides financial services to another person 
dealing with the other person’s accounts in the ordinary 
course of the first person’s business activities;
(d) the actions of a participant in a clearing and settlement 
facility who has taken on the delivery or payment 
obligations, in relation to a particular financial product, of 
another person who is a party to a transaction relating to a 
financial product;
