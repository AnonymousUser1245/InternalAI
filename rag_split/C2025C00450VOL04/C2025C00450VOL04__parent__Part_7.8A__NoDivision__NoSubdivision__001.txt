determinations
Persons who make target market determinations

determination.
Note 1: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see 
subsection 1311(1)).

burden in relation to conduct being excluded conduct (see 
subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code).

For relief from liability to a civil penalty relating to this subsection, 
see section 1317S.
(2) A person is not taken to have failed to take reasonable steps for the 
purpose of subsection (1) merely because:
(a) retail product distribution conduct of a regulated person 
(other than the person) in relation to the product is 
inconsistent with the target market determination; or
(b) a retail client who is not in the target market for the product 
acquires the product.

retail clients in respect of the financial product (except excluded 
conduct) must not be engaged in while the order is in force. The 
order is not a legislative instrument.
(3) Before making an order under subsection (2), ASIC must:
(a) hold a hearing; and
(b) give a reasonable opportunity to any interested person to 
make oral or written submissions to ASIC on whether an 
order should be made.
(4) If ASIC considers that any delay in making an order under 
subsection (2) pending the holding of a hearing would be 
prejudicial to the public interest, ASIC may make an interim order 
under that subsection. The interim order may be made without 
holding a hearing and lasts for 21 days after the day on which it is 
made unless revoked before then.
(5) At any time during the hearing, ASIC may make an interim order 
under subsection (2). The interim order lasts until:
(a) ASIC makes an order under subsection (2) after the 
conclusion of the hearing; or
(b) the interim order is revoked;
whichever happens first.

financial product, ASIC must serve a copy of the order on the 
person who made or was required to make the target market 
determination.
(7) The person on whom the order is served must take all reasonable 
steps to ensure that other people who engage in conduct to which 
the order applies are aware of the order.
Note 1: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see 
subsection 1311(1)).
Note 2: This subsection is also a civil penalty provision (see section 1317E). 
For relief from liability to a civil penalty relating to this subsection,
