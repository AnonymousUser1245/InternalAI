Part 2B.3  Contracts before registration
131  Contracts before registration

(1) If a person enters into, or purports to enter into, a contract on 
behalf of, or for the benefit of, a company before it is registered, 
the company becomes bound by the contract and entitled to its 
benefit if the company, or a company that is reasonably identifiable 
with it, is registered and ratifies the contract:
(a) within the time agreed to by the parties to the contract; or
(b) if there is no agreed time—within a reasonable time after the 
contract is entered into.
(2) The person is liable to pay damages to each other party to the 
pre-registration contract if the company is not registered, or the 
company is registered but does not ratify the contract or enter into 
a substitute for it:
(a) within the time agreed to by the parties to the contract; or
(b) if there is no agreed time—within a reasonable time after the 
contract is entered into.
The amount that the person is liable to pay to a party is the amount 
the company would be liable to pay to the party if the company had 
ratified the contract and then did not perform it at all.
(3) If proceedings are brought to recover damages under subsection (2) 
because the company is registered but does not ratify the 
pre-registration contract or enter into a substitute for it, the court 
may do anything that it considers appropriate in the circumstances, 
including ordering the company to do 1 or more of the following:
(a) pay all or part of the damages that the person is liable to pay;
(b) transfer property that the company received because of the 
contract to a party to the contract;
(c) pay an amount to a party to the contract.
