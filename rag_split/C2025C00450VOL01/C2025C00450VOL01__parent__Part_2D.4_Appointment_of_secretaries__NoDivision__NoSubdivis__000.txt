Part 2D.4  Appointment of secretaries
204E  Effectiveness of acts by secretaries

(1) An act done by a secretary is effective even if their appointment, or 
the continuance of their appointment, is invalid because the 
company or secretary did not comply with the company’s 
constitution (if any) or any provision of this Act.
(2) Subsection (1) does not deal with the question whether an effective 
act by a secretary:
(a) binds the company in its dealings with other people; or
(b) makes the company liable to another person.
Note: The kinds of acts that this section validates are those that are only 
legally effective if the person doing them is a secretary (for example, 
signing and sending out a notice of a meeting of directors if the 
company’s constitution authorises the secretary to do so or signing a 
document to be lodged with ASIC). Sections 128-130 contain rules 
about the assumptions people are entitled to make when dealing with a 
company and its officers.
