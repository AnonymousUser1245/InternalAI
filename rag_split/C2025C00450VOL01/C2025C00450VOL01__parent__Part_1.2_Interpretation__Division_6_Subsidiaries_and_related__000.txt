may be.

exercisable by a person by virtue of such shares, are to be

50AA  Meaning of control

(1) For the purposes of this Act, an entity controls a second entity if 
the first entity has the capacity to determine the outcome of 
decisions about the second entity’s financial and operating policies.
(2) In determining whether the first entity has this capacity:
(a) the practical influence the first entity can exert (rather than 
the rights it can enforce) is the issue to be considered; and
(b) any practice or pattern of behaviour affecting the second 
entity’s financial or operating policies is to be taken into 
account (even if it involves a breach of an agreement or a 
breach of trust).
(3) The first entity does not control the second entity merely because 
the first entity and a third entity jointly have the capacity to 
determine the outcome of decisions about the second entity’s 
financial and operating policies.
