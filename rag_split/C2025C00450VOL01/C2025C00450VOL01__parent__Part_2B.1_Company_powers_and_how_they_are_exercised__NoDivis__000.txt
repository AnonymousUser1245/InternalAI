(1) If a company has a constitution, it may contain an express 
restriction on, or a prohibition of, the company’s exercise of any of 
its powers. The exercise of a power by the company is not invalid 
merely because it is contrary to an express restriction or prohibition 
in the company’s constitution.

objects. An act of the company is not invalid merely because it is 
contrary to or beyond any objects in the company’s constitution.
