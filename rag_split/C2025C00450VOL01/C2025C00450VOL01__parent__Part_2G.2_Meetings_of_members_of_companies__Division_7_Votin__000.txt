(1) A resolution put to the vote at a meeting of a company’s members 
may be decided on a show of hands unless a poll is demanded.

despite this subsection (see section 250JA).

any proxy votes have been received and how the proxy votes are to 
be cast.
(2) On a show of hands, a declaration by the chair is conclusive 
evidence of the result, provided that the declaration reflects the 
show of hands and the votes of the proxies received. Neither the 
chair nor the minutes need to state the number or proportion of the 
votes recorded in favour or against.
Note: Even though the chair’s declaration is conclusive of the voting results, 
the members present may demand a poll (see paragraph 250L(3)(c)).
