2.1 Proprietary company for small business

Generally, a proprietary company limited by shares is the most 
suitable company for use by small business. Such a proprietary 
company must have a least 1 shareholder but no more than 50 
shareholders (not counting employee shareholders, CSF 
shareholders, or holders of shares issued pursuant to CSF offers 
that have yet to be traded in certain ways). It may have 1 or more 
directors.

3  Setting up a new company

The operators of small businesses can either buy “shelf” companies 
or set up new companies themselves.

Part 1.5  Small business guide
3.1 “Shelf” companies

The operator of a small business may find it more convenient to 
buy a “shelf” company (a company that has already been registered 
but has not traded) from businesses which set up companies for 
this purpose or from some legal or accounting firms.

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/20253.2 Setting up a company
To set up a new company themselves, the operator must apply to 
ASIC for registration of the company.
A proprietary company limited by shares must have at least 1 
shareholder.
To obtain registration, a person must lodge a properly completed 
application form with ASIC. The form must set out certain 
information including details of every person who has consented to 
be a shareholder, director or company secretary of the company.
The company comes into existence when ASIC registers it.
[sections 117—119, 135—136, 140]

Part 1.5  Small business guide
3.3 ACN and name

When a company is registered, ASIC allocates to it a unique 9 digit 
number called the Australian Company Number (ACN). (For use 
of the ACN see 4.1).
In practice, a new company must have a name that is different from 
the name of a company that is already registered. A proprietary 
company limited by shares must have the words “Proprietary 
Limited” as part of its name. Those words can be abbreviated to 
“Pty Ltd”.
A proprietary company may adopt its ACN as its name. If it does 
so, its name must also contain the words “Australian Company 
Number” (which can be abbreviated to “ACN”). For example, the 
company’s name might be “ACN 123 456 789 Pty Ltd”.

Part 1.5  Small business guide
3.4 Contracts entered into before the company is registered

A company can ratify a contract entered into by someone on its 
behalf or for its benefit before it was registered. If the company 
does not ratify the contract, the person who entered into the 
contract may be personally liable.

3.5 First shareholders, directors and company secretary

A person listed with their consent as a shareholder, director or 
company secretary in the application for registration of the 
company becomes a shareholder, director or company secretary of 
the company on its registration.
The same person may be both a director of the company and the 
company secretary.
See 5.1 and 5.2 for directors and 5.4 for company secretaries. See

3.6 Issuing shares

It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that, before issuing new shares, a 
company must first offer them to the existing shareholders in the 
proportions that the shareholders already hold. A company may 
issue shares at a price it determines.
[sections 254B, 254D]

Part 1.5  Small business guide
3.7 Registered office

A company must have a registered office in Australia and must 
inform ASIC of the location of the office. A post office box cannot 
be the registered office of a company. The purpose of the 
registered office is to have a place where all communications and 
notices to the company may be sent.
If the company does not occupy the premises where its registered 
office is located, the occupier of the premises must agree in writing 
to having the company’s registered office located there.
A proprietary company is not required to open its registered office 
to the public but this does not affect its obligation to make 
documents available for inspection.

shareholders. A company must keep its registers at:

• the company’s principal place of business; or
• a place (whether on premises of the company or of 
someone else) where the work in maintaining the register 
is done; or
• another place approved by ASIC.

computer.
If a register is kept on computer, its contents must be capable of 
being printed out in hard copy.

the public. The company’s name and its ACN or ABN (if the last 9 
digits are the same, and in the same order, as the last 9 digits of its 
ACN) must appear:
• on some of its public documents; and
• on its cheques and negotiable instruments; and
• on all documents lodged with ASIC; and

Each year, ASIC issues each company with an extract of 
particulars within 2 weeks of the company’s review date (which is 
generally the anniversary of the company’s registration). The 
extract includes details recorded on ASIC’s database such as:
• names and addresses of each director and company 
secretary;
