Each member of a joint 
membership must sign.

members if the wording of the resolution and statement is identical 
in each copy.

(4) The resolution is passed when the last member signs.

holding a meeting satisfies any requirement in this Act:

resolution—by giving members that information or document 
with the document to be signed; and
(b) to lodge with ASIC a copy of a notice of meeting to consider 
the resolution—by lodging a copy of the document to be 
signed by members; and
