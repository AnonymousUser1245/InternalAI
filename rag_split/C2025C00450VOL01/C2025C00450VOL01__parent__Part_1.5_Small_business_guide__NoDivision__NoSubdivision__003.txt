7  Signing company documents

A company’s power to sign, discharge and otherwise deal with 
contracts, or execute documents, can be exercised by an individual 
acting with the company’s authority and on its behalf. A company 
can deal with contracts without using a common seal.
A company may execute a document by having it signed by:
• 2 directors of the company; or
• a director and the company secretary; or
• for a company with a sole director who is also the sole 
secretary—that director; or
• for a company with a sole director and no company 
secretary—that director.
If the document is to have effect as a deed, it should be expressed 
to be a deed.
[sections 126—127]
A company is not required to have a common seal. If it does, the 
seal must show the company’s name and its ACN or ABN (if the 
last 9 digits are the same, and in the same order, as the last 9 digits 
of its ACN). The seal is equivalent to the company’s signature and 
may be used on important company documents such as mortgages.

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/20258  Funding the company’s operations
The shareholders may fund the company’s operations by lending 
money to the company or by taking up other shares in the 
company. Except if it is raising funds from its own employees or 
shareholders or under a CSF offer, a proprietary company must not 
engage in any fundraising activity that would require disclosure to 
investors under Chapter 6D (for example, advertising in a 
newspaper inviting people to invest in the company).
The company may also borrow money from banks and other 
financial organisations.
Anyone who has lent money, or provided credit, to the company 
may ask for a security interest in the company’s assets to secure the 
performance by the company of its obligations.

9  Returns to shareholders

Shareholders can take money out of the company in a number of 
ways, but only if the company complies with its constitution (if 
any), the Corporations Act and all other relevant laws. If a 
company pays out money in a way that results in the company 
being unable to pay its debts as they fall due, its directors may be 
liable:
• to pay compensation; and
• for criminal and civil penalties.

10.1 The small/large distinction

The accounting requirements imposed on a proprietary company 
under the Corporations Act depend on whether the company is 
classified as small or large. A company’s classification can change 
from 1 financial year to another as its circumstances change.
A company is classified as small for a financial year if it satisfies at 
least 2 of the following tests:
• gross operating revenue of less than $10 million for the 
year
• gross assets of less than $5 million at the end of the year
• fewer than 50 employees at the end of the year.

10.2 Financial records

Under the Corporations Act, all proprietary companies must keep 
sufficient financial records to record and explain their transactions 
and financial position and to allow true and fair financial 
statements to be prepared and audited. Financial record here 
means some kind of systematic record of the company’s financial 
transactions—not merely a collection of receipts, invoices, bank 
statements and cheque butts. Financial records may be kept on 
computer.

10.3 Preparing annual financial reports and directors’ reports

The Corporations Act requires a small proprietary company to 
prepare an annual financial report (an annual profit and loss 
statement, a balance sheet and a statement of cash flows) and a 
directors’ report (about the company’s operations, dividends paid 
or recommended, options issued etc.) if:
• the shareholders with at least 5% of the votes in the 
company direct it to do so; or
• ASIC directs it to do so; or
• it has one or more CSF shareholders at any time during the 
financial year.

Section 11

Corporations Act 2001 263
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Unless the shareholders’ direction specifies otherwise, the 
company must prepare the annual financial report in accordance 
with the applicable accounting standards.
Although the Corporations Act itself may not require a small 
proprietary company to prepare a financial report except in the 
circumstances mentioned, the company may need to prepare the 
annual financial reports for the purposes of other laws (for 
example, income tax laws). Moreover, good business practice may 
also make it advisable for the company to prepare the financial 
reports so that it can monitor and better manage its financial 
position.
Large proprietary companies must prepare annual financial reports 
and a directors’ report, have the financial report audited and send 
both reports to shareholders. They must also lodge the annual 
financial reports with ASIC unless exempted.

There are remedies available to a shareholder of a company if:
• the affairs of the company are being conducted in a way 
that is unfair to that shareholder or to other shareholders of 
the company; or

that is against the interests of the company as a whole.
A Court may, for example, order the winding up of a company or 
the appointment of a receiver.
