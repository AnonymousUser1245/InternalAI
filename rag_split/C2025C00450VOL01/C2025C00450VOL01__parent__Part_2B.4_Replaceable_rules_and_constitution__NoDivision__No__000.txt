Section 136

Corporations Act 2001 295
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025The section or subsection does not apply to a proprietary company 
while the same person is both its sole director and sole shareholder.
Note 1: See sections 198E, 201F and 202C for the special provisions that 
apply to a proprietary company while the same person is both its sole 
director and sole shareholder.
Note 2: A company may include in its constitution (by reference or otherwise) 
a replaceable rule that does not otherwise apply to it.
Note 3: Paragraph (a) does not apply for CCIVs: see section 1223A.
Company’s constitution can displace or modify replaceable rules
(2) A provision of a section or subsection that applies to a company as 
a replaceable rule can be displaced or modified by the company’s 
constitution.
Failure to comply with replaceable rules
(3) A failure to comply with the replaceable rules as they apply to a 
company is not of itself a contravention of this Act (so the 
provisions about criminal liability, civil liability and injunctions do 
not apply).
Note: Replaceable rules that apply to a company have effect as a contract 
(see section 140).

Part 2B.4  Replaceable rules and constitution
136  Constitution of a company

(1) A company adopts a constitution:
(a) on registration—if each person specified in the application 
for the company’s registration as a person who consents to 
become a member agrees in writing to the terms of a 
constitution before the application is lodged; or
(b) after registration—if the company passes a special resolution 
adopting a constitution or a court order is made under 
section 233 that requires the company to adopt the 
constitution.
Note 1: The Life Insurance Act 1995 has rules about how benefit fund rules 
become part of a company’s constitution and about amending those 
rules. They override this Act (see section 1348 of this Act).
