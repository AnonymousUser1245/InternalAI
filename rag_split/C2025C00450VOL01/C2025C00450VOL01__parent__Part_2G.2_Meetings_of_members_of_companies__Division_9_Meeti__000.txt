Section 250X

Corporations Act 2001 533
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025250X  Ensuring there are at least 3 directors after spill meeting
(1) This section applies if there would be fewer than 3 directors of the 
company immediately after the spill meeting apart from this 
section.
Note: Subsection 201A(2) requires the company to have at least 3 directors.
(2) Enough directors to ensure that the company has 3 directors 
immediately after the spill meeting are taken to have been 
appointed, by resolution passed at the spill meeting, from the 
persons who:
(a) gave the company signed consents to act as directors of the 
company in anticipation of being appointed by such a 
resolution; and
(b) were not appointed as directors by such a resolution apart 
from this section.
Note: The number of directors taken under subsection (2) to have been 
appointed is the difference between 3 and the number of directors 
holding office immediately after the spill meeting apart from this 
section.
(3) The persons taken to have been appointed are those with the 
highest percentages of votes favouring their appointment cast at the 
spill meeting on the resolution for their appointment (even if less 
than half the votes cast on the resolution were in favour of their 
appointment).
Example: Suppose that, under subsection (2), 2 directors are taken to have been 
appointed, and the percentages of votes favouring appointment were

Part 2G.2  Meetings of members of companies
Division 9  Meetings arising from concerns about remuneration reports
50% for Jean, 40% for Karl and 30% for Lionel. Jean and Karl would

both be taken to have been appointed directors, but Lionel would not.
(4) For the purposes of this section, if 2 or more persons have the same 
percentage of votes favouring their appointment, the one of those 
persons chosen by the director or directors who hold office apart 
from this subsection is taken to have a higher percentage than the 
rest of those persons.
Note: A director who holds office apart from subsection (4) could make a 
series of choices if 3 or more persons all have the same percentage of
