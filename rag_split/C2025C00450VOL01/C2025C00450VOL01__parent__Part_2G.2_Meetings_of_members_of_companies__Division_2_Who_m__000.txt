249E  Failure of directors to call general meeting

(1) Members with more than 50% of the votes of all of the members 
who make a request under section 249D may call and arrange to 
hold a general meeting if the directors do not do so within 21 days 
after the request is given to the company.
(2) The meeting must be called in the same way—so far as is 
possible—in which general meetings of the company may be 
called. The meeting must be held not later than 3 months after the 
request is given to the company.
(3) To call the meeting the members requesting the meeting may ask 
the company under section 173 for a copy of the register of 
members. Despite paragraph 173(3)(b), the company must give the 
members the copy of the register without charge.
(4) The company must pay the reasonable expenses the members 
incurred because the directors failed to call and arrange to hold the 
meeting.
(4A) An offence based on subsection (3) or (4) is an offence of strict 
liability.
Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code.
(5) The company may recover the amount of the expenses from the 
directors. However, a director is not liable for the amount if they 
prove that they took all reasonable steps to cause the directors to 
comply with section 249D. The directors who are liable are jointly 
and individually liable for the amount. If a director who is liable 
for the amount does not reimburse the company, the company must 
deduct the amount from any sum payable as fees to, or 
remuneration of, the director.
