Part 1.5  Small business guide
1.1 Separate legal entity that has its own powers

As far as the law is concerned, a company has a separate legal 
existence that is distinct from that of its owners, managers, 
operators, employees and agents. A company has its own property, 
its own rights and its own obligations. A company’s money and 
other assets belong to the company and must be used for the 
company’s purposes.
A company has the powers of an individual, including the powers 
to:
• own and dispose of property and other assets
• enter into contracts
• sue and be sued.

1.2 Limited liability of shareholders

Shareholders of a company are not liable (in their capacity as 
shareholders) for the company’s debts. As shareholders, their only 
obligation is to pay the company any amount unpaid on their 
shares if they are called upon to do so. However, particularly if a 
shareholder is also a director, this limitation may be affected by 
other laws and the commercial practices discussed in 1.3 and 1.4.
[section 516]

Part 1.5  Small business guide
1.3 Director’s liability for company’s debts

A director of a company may be liable for debts incurred by the 
company at a time when the company itself is unable to pay those 
debts as they fall due.
A director of a company may be liable to compensate the company 
for any losses the company suffers from a breach of certain of the 
director’s duties to the company (see 5.3).
In addition to having liability for the company’s debts or to pay 
compensation to the company, a director may also be subject to a 
civil penalty.
If a company holds property on trust, a director of the company 
may be liable in some circumstances for liabilities incurred by the 
company as trustee.

1.4 Director’s liability as guarantor/security over personal assets

• for some form of security over their house or personal 
assets to secure the performance by the company of its 
obligations.
The director of a company may, for example, be asked by a bank to 
give a mortgage over their house to secure the company’s 
repayment of a loan. If the company does not repay the loan as 
agreed with the bank, the director may lose the house.

Part 1.5  Small business guide
1.5 Continuous existence

A company continues to exist even if 1 or more of its shareholders 
or directors sells their shares, dies or leaves the company. If a 
company has only 1 shareholder who is also the only director of 
the company and that person dies, their personal representative is 
able to ensure that the company continues to operate.
[sections 119, 224A]

Part 1.5  Small business guide
1.6 Rules for the internal management of a company

The Corporations Act contains a basic set of rules for the internal 
management of a company (appointments, meetings etc.).
Some of these rules are mandatory for all companies. There are a 
few special rules for single shareholder/single director companies.
Other internal management rules in the Corporations Act are 
replaceable rules. The replaceable rules do not apply to:
• a single shareholder/single director company; or
• a company that had a constitution before the introduction 
of the replaceable rules regime and has not repealed it.
A company does not need to have a separate constitution of its 
own; it can simply take advantage of the rules in the Corporations 
Act. The company will need a constitution only if it wants to 
displace, modify or add to the replaceable rules.

1.7 How a company acts

A company does not have a physical existence. It must act through 
other people.
Individual directors, the company secretary, company employees 
or agents may be authorised to enter into contracts that bind the 
company (see 7).
In some circumstances, a company will be bound by something 
done by another person (see 1.8).

Part 1.5  Small business guide
1.8 Directors

The directors of a company are responsible for managing the 
company’s business. It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that generally 
the directors may exercise all the powers of the company except a 
power that the Corporations Act, a replaceable rule or a provision 
of the company’s constitution (if any) requires the company to 
exercise in general meeting.
The only director of a company who is also the only shareholder is 
responsible for managing the company’s business and may 
exercise all of the company’s powers.
The Corporations Act sets out rules dealing with the calling and 
conduct of directors’ meetings. Directors must keep a written 
record (minutes) of their resolutions and meetings.
There are 2 ways that directors may pass resolutions:
• at a meeting; or
• by having all of the directors record and sign their 
decision.
If a company has only 1 director, the sole director may also pass a 
resolution by recording and signing their decision.

1.9 Shareholders

The shareholders of a company own the company, but the 
company has a separate legal existence and the company’s assets 
belong to the company.
Shareholders can make decisions about the company by passing a 
resolution, usually at a meeting. A “special resolution” usually 
involves more important questions affecting the company as a 
whole or the rights of some or all of its shareholders.
There are 2 ways that shareholders may pass a resolution:
• at a meeting; or
• by having all of the shareholders record and sign their 
decision.
If a meeting is held, an ordinary resolution must be passed by a 
majority of the votes cast by shareholders of the company entitled 
to vote on the resolution at the meeting in person or by proxy (if 
proxies are allowed). A special resolution must be passed by at 
least 75% of the votes cast by shareholders of the company entitled 
to vote on the resolution and who vote at the meeting in person or 
by proxy (if proxies are allowed).
The sole shareholder of a company may pass a resolution by 
recording and signing their decision.
A company must keep a written record (minutes) of the members’ 
resolutions and meetings.
