A company limited by guarantee must not pay a dividend to its 
members.

Part 2H.5  Dividends
254T  Circumstances in which a dividend may be paid

(1) A company must not pay a dividend unless:
(a) the company’s assets exceed its liabilities immediately before 
the dividend is declared and the excess is sufficient for the 
payment of the dividend; and
(b) the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the 
company’s shareholders as a whole; and
(c) the payment of the dividend does not materially prejudice the 
company’s ability to pay its creditors.
Note 1: As an example, the payment of a dividend would materially prejudice 
the company’s ability to pay its creditors if the company would 
become insolvent as a result of the payment.
Note 2: For a director’s duty to prevent insolvent trading on payment of 
dividends, see section 588G.
Note 3: Section 1230M applies to a CCIV instead of this section.
(2) Assets and liabilities are to be calculated for the purposes of this 
section in accordance with accounting standards in force at the 
relevant time (even if the standard does not otherwise apply to the 
financial year of some or all of the companies concerned).

Part 2H.5  Dividends
254V  When does the company incur a debt?

time for payment of a dividend. The debt arises only when the time 
fixed for payment arrives and the decision to pay the dividend may 
be revoked at any time before then.
(2) However, if the company has a constitution and it provides for the 
declaration of dividends, the company incurs a debt when the 
dividend is declared.

dividend rights unless:
(a) the company has a constitution and it provides for the shares 
to have different dividend rights; or

resolution of the company.
Note: Section 1230N is about dividend rights in a CCIV.
