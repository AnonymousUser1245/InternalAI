Part 2J.1  Share capital reductions and share buy-backs
Division 4  Application of this Part to MCI mutual entities
258G  Application of this Part to MCI mutual entities

(1) For the purposes of applying this Part to an MCI mutual entity, a 
reference (other than in section 258B) to a shareholder of the entity 
is taken to include a non-shareholder mutual member of the entity.
(2) For the purposes of applying Division 1 to an MCI mutual entity:
(a) any reduction of the entity’s share capital that relates to MCIs 
is taken to be a selective reduction; and
(b) the reference to all ordinary shareholders in 
paragraph 256C(2)(b) is taken to be a reference to all 
members of the entity.
(3) For the purposes of applying Division 2 to an MCI mutual entity:
(a) any scheme to buy back MCIs is taken not to be an equal 
access scheme; and
(b) subsections 257B(4) and (5) (the 10/12 limit) have effect in 
relation to MCIs issued by a mutual entity as if each MCI 
were a voting share with one vote attached to it; and
(c) the reference to all ordinary shareholders in 
paragraph 257D(1)(b) is taken to be a reference to all 
members of the entity.
(4) To avoid doubt, this section does not have the effect of treating a 
non-shareholder mutual member’s membership of an MCI mutual 
entity as a share.
