253S  Electronic recording and keeping of minute books

(1) If information is required to be recorded in a minute book, the 
information may be recorded in electronic form if, at the time of 
the recording of the information, it was reasonable to expect that 
the information would be readily accessible so as to be useable for 
subsequent reference.

(2) If a minute book is required to be kept at a place, the requirement 
is taken to be satisfied if:
(a) an electronic form of the minute book is open for inspection 
at the place in accordance with this Act; and
(b) having regard to all the relevant circumstances at the time of 
the generation of the electronic form of the minute book, the 
method of generating the electronic form of the minute book 
provided a reliable means of assuring the maintenance of the 
integrity of the information contained in the minute book; 
and
(c) at the time of the generation of the electronic form of the 
minute book, it was reasonable to expect that the information 
contained in the electronic form of the minute book would be 
readily accessible so as to be useable for subsequent 
reference.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the integrity of information 
contained in a minute book is maintained if, and only if, the 
information has remained complete and unaltered, apart from:
(a) the addition of any endorsement; or
(b) any immaterial change;
which arises in the normal course of communication, storage or 
display.
