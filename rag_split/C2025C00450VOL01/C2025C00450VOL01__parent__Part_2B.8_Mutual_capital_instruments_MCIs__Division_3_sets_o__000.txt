Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act

Part 2B.8  Mutual capital instruments (MCIs)
Division 3 sets out a special procedure for amending the
167AD  Meaning of MCI

(1) A share in a mutual entity is an MCI (short for mutual capital 
instrument) if:
(a) paragraphs 167AC(a), (b), (c) and (d) apply to the entity; and
(b) the share meets the requirements in sections 167AE and

Part 2B.8  Mutual capital instruments (MCIs)
Division 3 sets out a special procedure for amending the
167AF.

(2) To avoid doubt, if a share that is an MCI ceases to meet one or 
more of those requirements, the share ceases to be an MCI.
(3) Nothing in this Division requires an MCI mutual entity to treat the 
holders of MCIs in the same way as members of the entity who do 
not hold MCIs.
Note: For example, this Division does not require an MCI mutual entity that 
provides services to a class of members to provide those services to 
holders of MCIs.
