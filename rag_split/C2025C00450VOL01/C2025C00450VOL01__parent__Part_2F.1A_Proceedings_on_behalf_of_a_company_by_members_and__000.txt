Part 2F.1A  Proceedings on behalf of a company by members and others
468 Corporations Act 2001

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(a) it is probable that the company will not itself bring the 
proceedings, or properly take responsibility for them, or for 
the steps in them; and
(b) the applicant is acting in good faith; and
(c) it is in the best interests of the company that the applicant be 
granted leave; and
(d) if the applicant is applying for leave to bring proceedings—
there is a serious question to be tried; and
(e) either:
(i) at least 14 days before making the application, the 
applicant gave written notice to the company of the 
intention to apply for leave and of the reasons for 
applying; or
(ii) it is appropriate to grant leave even though 
subparagraph (i) is not satisfied.
(3) A rebuttable presumption that granting leave is not in the best 
interests of the company arises if it is established that:
(a) the proceedings are:
(i) by the company against a third party; or
(ii) by a third party against the company; and
(b) the company has decided:
(i) not to bring the proceedings; or
(ii) not to defend the proceedings; or
(iii) to discontinue, settle or compromise the proceedings; 
and
(c) all of the directors who participated in that decision:
(i) acted in good faith for a proper purpose; and
(ii) did not have a material personal interest in the decision; 
and
(iii) informed themselves about the subject matter of the 
decision to the extent they reasonably believed to be 
appropriate; and
(iv) rationally believed that the decision was in the best 
interests of the company.

related party of the company; or
(ii) the company is not a public company and the person 
would not be a related party of the company if the 
company were a public company; and

granted under section 237:
(a) a member, former member, or a person entitled to be 
registered as a member, of the company or of a related body 
corporate;
(b) an officer, or former officer, of the company.

intervened—the substituted person is taken to have brought 
those proceedings or to have made that intervention.

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025239  Effect of ratification by members
(1) If the members of a company ratify or approve conduct, the 
ratification or approval:
(a) does not prevent a person from bringing or intervening in 
proceedings with leave under section 237 or from applying 
for leave under that section; and
(b) does not have the effect that proceedings brought or 
intervened in with leave under section 237 must be 
determined in favour of the defendant, or that an application 
for leave under that section must be refused.
(2) If members of a company ratify or approve conduct, the Court may 
take the ratification or approval into account in deciding what order 
or judgment (including as to damages) to make in proceedings 
brought or intervened in with leave under section 237 or in relation 
to an application for leave under that section. In doing this, it must 
have regard to:
(a) how well-informed about the conduct the members were 
when deciding whether to ratify or approve the conduct; and
(b) whether the members who ratified or approved the conduct 
were acting for proper purposes.
