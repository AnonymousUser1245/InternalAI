personnel for the company or, if the company is part of 
a consolidated entity, for the entity.
(6) ASIC may by writing declare that:
(a) subsection (4) does not apply to a specified resolution; or
(b) subsection (4) does not prevent the casting of a vote, on a 
specified resolution, by or on behalf of a specified entity;
but may do so only if satisfied that the declaration will not cause 
unfair prejudice to the interests of any member of the listed 
company. The declaration has effect accordingly. The declaration

a vote on the resolution is cast by or on behalf of the person in 
contravention of that subsection (whether or not the resolution is 
passed).
Note: A contravention of this subsection is an offence: see 
subsection 1311(1).

except subsections (4) and (7) and subsection 250BD(1), and 
section 1311 and Schedule 3 so far as they relate to any of those 
subsections.
Note: This means the vote is not counted in working out a percentage of 
votes cast or whether the resolution is passed, and does not affect the 
validity of the resolution.

if, and only if, it is cast:
(a) as proxy for the person; or
(b) otherwise on behalf of the person; or
