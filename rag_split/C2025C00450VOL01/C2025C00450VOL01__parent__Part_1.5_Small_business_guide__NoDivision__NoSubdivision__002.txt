Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Australia. If a company has more than 1 director, at least 1 of the 
directors must ordinarily reside in Australia.
A director must consent in writing to holding the position of 
director. The company must keep the consent and must notify 
ASIC of the appointment.
In some circumstances, the Corporations Act imposes the duties 
and obligations of a director on a person who, although not 
formally appointed as a director of a company, nevertheless acts as 
a director or gives instructions to the formally appointed directors 
as to how they should act.
The Court or ASIC may prohibit a person from being a director or 
from otherwise being involved in the management of a company if, 
for example, the person has breached the Corporations Act.
A person needs the Court’s permission to be a director if the person 
has been convicted of certain offences or is, in some 
circumstances, unable to pay their debts as they fall due.
Generally, a director may resign by giving notice of the resignation 
to the company. A director who resigns may notify ASIC of the 
resignation. If the director does not do so, the company must notify 
ASIC of the director’s resignation.

notice of the resignation to the company. A company secretary 
who resigns may notify ASIC of the resignation. If the company 
secretary does not do so, the company must notify ASIC of the 
company secretary’s resignation.
