197  Directors liable for debts and other obligations incurred by

corporation as trustee
(1) A person who is a director of a corporation when it incurs a 
liability while acting, or purporting to act, as trustee, is liable to 
discharge the whole or a part of the liability if the corporation:
(a) has not discharged, and cannot discharge, the liability or that 
part of it; and
(b) is not entitled to be fully indemnified against the liability out 
of trust assets solely because of one or more of the following:
(i) a breach of trust by the corporation;
(ii) the corporation’s acting outside the scope of its powers 
as trustee;
(iii) a term of the trust denying, or limiting, the corporation’s 
right to be indemnified against the liability.
The person is liable both individually and jointly with the 
corporation and anyone else who is liable under this subsection.
Note: The person will not be liable under this subsection merely because 
there are insufficient trust assets out of which the corporation can be 
indemnified.
(2) The person is not liable under subsection (1) if the person would be 
entitled to have been fully indemnified by 1 of the other directors 
against the liability had all the directors of the corporation been 
trustees when the liability was incurred.
(3) This section does not apply to a liability incurred outside Australia 
by a foreign company.
(3A) This section does not apply to a liability incurred by a corporation 
that is:
(a) a notified foreign passport fund; or
(b) the operator of a notified foreign passport fund acting in that 
capacity.
