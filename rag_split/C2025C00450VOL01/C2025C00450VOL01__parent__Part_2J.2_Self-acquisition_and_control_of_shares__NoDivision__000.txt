Part 2J.2  Self-acquisition and control of shares
Section 259E

Corporations Act 2001 619
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025259E  When a company controls an entity
(1) For the purposes of this Part, a company controls an entity if the 
company has the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions 
about the entity’s financial and operating policies.
(2) In determining whether a company has this capacity:
(a) the practical influence the company can exert (rather than the 
rights it can enforce) is the issue to be addressed; and
(b) any practice or pattern of behaviour affecting the entity’s 
financial or operating policies is to be taken into account 
(even if it involves a breach of an agreement or a breach of 
trust).
(3) Merely because the company and an unrelated entity jointly have 
the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about another 
entity’s financial and operating policies, the company does not 
control the other entity.
(4) A company is not taken to control an entity merely because of a 
capacity that it is under a legal obligation to exercise for the benefit 
of someone other than its shareholders.
Note: This situation could arise, for example, if the company holds shares as 
a trustee or is performing duties as a liquidator.
