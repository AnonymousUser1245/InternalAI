Trust property vests in the Commonwealth
(1A) On deregistration, all property that the company held on trust

that property vests in ASIC. This subsection extends to property 
situated outside this jurisdiction.
Rights and powers in respect of property
(3) Under subsection (1A) or (2), the Commonwealth or ASIC takes 
only the same property rights that the company itself held. If the 
company held particular property subject to a security or other 
interest or claim, the Commonwealth or ASIC takes the property 
subject to that interest or claim.
Note: See also subsection 601AE(3)—which deals with liabilities that a law 
imposes on the property (particularly liabilities such as rates, taxes 
and other charges).
(3A) The Commonwealth has, subject to its obligations as trustee of the 
trust, all the powers of an owner over property vested in it under 
subsection (1A).
Note: Section 601AF confers additional powers on the Commonwealth to 
fulfil outstanding obligations of the deregistered company.
(4) ASIC has all the powers of an owner over property vested in it 
under subsection (2).
Note: Section 601AF confers additional powers on ASIC to fulfil 
outstanding obligations of the deregistered company.

(5) The directors of the company immediately before deregistration 
must keep the company’s books for 3 years after the deregistration. 
(6) Subsection (5) does not apply to books that a liquidator has to keep 
under subsection 542(2), or subsection 70-35(1) of Schedule 2 
(retention and return or destruction of books).

601AE  What the Commonwealth or ASIC does with the property
Trust property vested in the Commonwealth
(1) If property vests in the Commonwealth under 
subsection 601AD(1A), the Commonwealth may:
(a) continue to act as trustee; or
(b) apply to a court for the appointment of a new trustee.
Note: Under paragraph (1)(a), the Commonwealth may be able to transfer 
the property to a new trustee chosen in accordance with the trust 
instrument.
(1A) If the Commonwealth continues to act as trustee in respect of the 
property, subject to its obligations as trustee, the Commonwealth:
(a) in the case of money—must credit the amount of the money 
to a special account (within the meaning of the Public 
Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013); or
(b) otherwise:
(i) may sell or dispose of the property as it thinks fit; and
(ii) if the Commonwealth does so—must credit the amount 
of the proceeds to a special account (within the meaning 
of the Public Governance, Performance and 
Accountability Act 2013).
Note: ASIC may, for and on behalf of the Commonwealth, perform all the 
duties and exercise all the powers of the Commonwealth as trustee in 
relation to property held on trust by the Commonwealth (see 
subsection 8(6) of the ASIC Act).
Property vested in ASIC
(2) If property vests in ASIC under subsection 601AD(2), ASIC may:

(b) apply any money it receives to:
(i) defray expenses incurred by ASIC in exercising its 
powers in relation to the company under this Chapter; 
and
(ii) make payments authorised by subsection (3).
ASIC must deal with the rest (if any) under Part 9.7.
Obligations attaching to property vested in the Commonwealth
(2A) For the purposes of subsection (3), if any liability is imposed on 
property under a law of the Commonwealth immediately before the 
property vests in the Commonwealth under 
subsection 601AD(1A), then:
(a) immediately after that time, the liability applies to the 
Commonwealth as if the Commonwealth were a body 
corporate; and
(b) the Commonwealth is liable to make notional payments to 
discharge that liability.
Obligations attaching to property
(3) Any property that vests in the Commonwealth or ASIC under 
subsection 601AD(1A) or (2) remains subject to all liabilities 
imposed on the property under a law and does not have the benefit 
of any exemption that the property might otherwise have because it 
is vested in the Commonwealth or ASIC. These liabilities include a 
liability that:
(a) is a security interest in or claim on the property; and
(b) arises under a law that imposes rates, taxes or other charges.
Extent of Commonwealth’s and ASIC’s obligation
(4) The Commonwealth’s or ASIC’s obligation under subsection (2A) 
or (3) is limited to satisfying the liabilities out of the company’s 
property to the extent that the property is properly available to 
satisfy those liabilities.

property and that money.
601AF  The Commonwealth’s and ASIC’s power to fulfil 
outstanding obligations of deregistered company
The Commonwealth or ASIC may do an act on behalf of the 
company or its liquidator if the Commonwealth or ASIC is 
satisfied that the company or liquidator would be bound to do the 
act if the company still existed.
Note: This power is a general one and is not limited to acts in relation to 
property vested in the Commonwealth under subsection 601AD(1A), 
or ASIC under subsection 601AD(2). The Commonwealth or ASIC 
has all the powers that automatically flow from the vesting of property 
under that subsection (see subsections 601AD(3A) and (4)) and may 
exercise those powers whether or not the company was bound to do 
so.
601AG  Claims against insurers of deregistered company

Extended meaning of acquiring relevant interests—conversions 
and increases in voting rights

Part 6.1  Prohibited acquisitions of relevant interests in voting shares
  
Section 607
188 Corporations Act 2001
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(b) there is an increase in the number of votes that may be cast 
on a poll attached to voting shares that the person already had 
a relevant interest in.
The acquisition occurs when the securities become voting shares or 
the number of votes increases.
Note: Some examples of cases to which this subsection applies are:
•A person exercises a right to convert a non-voting preference 
share into an ordinary share that carries votes.
•A person pays up partly-paid shares with limited votes and 
this leads to an increase in the number of votes attached to the 
shares.
607  Effect on transactions
A transaction is not invalid merely because it involves a 
contravention of section 606.
608  Relevant interests in securities
Basic rule—relevant interest is holding, or controlling voting or 
disposal of, securities
(1) A person has a relevant interest in securities if they:
(a) are the holder of the securities; or
(b) have power to exercise, or control the exercise of, a right to 
vote attached to the securities; or
(c) have power to dispose of, or control the exercise of a power 
to dispose of, the securities.
It does not matter how remote the relevant interest is or how it 
arises. If 2 or more people can jointly exercise one of these powers, 
each of them is taken to have that power.
Extension to control exercisable through a trust, agreement or 
practice
(2) In this section, power or control includes:
(a) power or control that is indirect; and

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(b) power or control that is, or can be, exercised as a result of, by 
means of or by the revocation or breach of:
(i) a trust; or
(ii) an agreement; or
(iii) a practice; or
(iv) any combination of them;
whether or not they are enforceable; and
(c) power or control that is, or can be made, subject to restraint 
or restriction.
It does not matter whether the power or control is express or 
implied, formal or informal, exercisable alone or jointly with 
someone else. It does not matter that the power or control cannot 
be related to a particular security.
Extension to relevant interests held through bodies corporate
(3) A person has the relevant interests in any securities that any of the 
following has:
(a) a body corporate, or managed investment scheme, in which 
the person’s voting power is above 20%;
(b) a body corporate, or managed investment scheme, that the 
person controls.
Paragraph (a) does not apply to a relevant interest that the body 
corporate or scheme itself has in the securities merely because of 
the operation of that paragraph in relation to another body 
corporate or managed investment scheme.
(4) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(b), a person controls a body 
corporate if the person has the capacity to determine the outcome 
of decisions about the body corporate’s financial and operating 
policies.
(5) In determining whether a person has this capacity:
(a) the practical influence the person can exert (rather than the 
rights they can enforce) is the issue to be addressed; and
(b) any practice or pattern of behaviour affecting the body 
corporate’s financial or operating policies is to be taken into

(6) The person does not control the body corporate merely because the 
person and an entity that is not an associate jointly have the 
capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about the body 
corporate’s financial and operating policies.
(7) A person is not taken to control a body corporate merely because 
of a capacity they have if they are under a legal obligation to 
exercise that capacity for the benefit of:
(a) if the person is an individual—someone else; or
(b) if the person is a body corporate—someone other than its 
members.

(8) If at a particular time all the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) a person has a relevant interest in issued securities;
(b) the person (whether before or after acquiring the relevant 
interest):
(i) has entered or enters into an agreement with another 
person with respect to the securities; or
(ii) has given or gives another person an enforceable right, 
or has been or is given an enforceable right by another 
person, in relation to the securities (whether the right is 
enforceable presently or in the future and whether or not 
on the fulfilment of a condition); or
(iii) has granted or grants an option to, or has been or is 
granted an option by, another person with respect to the 
securities;
(c) the other person would have a relevant interest in the 
securities if the agreement were performed, the right enforced 
or the option exercised;
the other person is taken to already have a relevant interest in the 
securities.

securities merely because they hold securities on behalf of 
someone else in the ordinary course of their financial services

(b) enter into a position on behalf of the person under which the 
licensee has an obligation to make delivery of the securities 
by dealing in:

(ii) a financial product that, but for the product not being 
transferable, would be a warrant within the meaning of

to all the voting shares in the designated body (if any) that the 
person or an associate has a relevant interest in.

voting share in a designated body is the maximum number of votes 
that can be cast in respect of the share on a poll:
(a) if the election of directors is determined by the casting of 
votes attached to voting shares—on the election of a director 
of the designated body; or
(b) if the election of directors is not determined by the casting of 
votes attached to voting shares—on the adoption of a 
constitution for the designated body or the amendment of the 
body corporate’s constitution.
Note: The Takeovers Panel may decide that the setting or varying of voting 
rights in a way that affects control of a designated body is 
unacceptable circumstances under section 657A.
(3) If:
(a) a transaction in relation to, or an acquisition of an interest in, 
securities occurs; and
(b) before the transaction or acquisition, a person did not have a 
relevant interest in particular voting shares but an associate 
of the person did have a relevant interest in those shares; and
(c) because of the transaction or acquisition, the person acquires 
a relevant interest in those shares;
then, for the purposes of applying section 606 to the transaction or 
acquisition, the person’s voting power is taken to have increased 
because of the transaction or acquisition from what it would have 
been before the transaction or acquisition if the votes attached to 
those shares were disregarded to what it was after the transaction 
or acquisition (taking the votes attached to those shares into 
account).
(3A) However, subsection (3) does not apply in relation to a subsidiary 
acquiring an interest in securities from its holding company with 
the result that the subsidiary acquires a relevant interest in 
particular voting shares unless:

designated body that is a managed investment scheme:
(a) a reference to voting shares in the designated body is taken to 
be a reference to voting interests in the scheme; and
(b) a reference to the election of directors of the designated body 
is taken to be a reference to:
(i) if the scheme is a registered scheme—the appointment 
of a responsible entity for the scheme; or

appointment of a person to the office (by whatever 
name it is known) in relation to the scheme that 
corresponds most closely to the office of responsible 
entity of a registered scheme; and
(c) a reference to the designated body’s constitution is taken to 
be a reference to the scheme’s constitution.

offered to acquire under the bid (whether the 
acquisitions happened under the bid or otherwise).
