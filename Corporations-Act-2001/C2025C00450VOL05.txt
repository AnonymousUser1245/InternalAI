(2) Before a regulated acquisition of a financial product occurs 
pursuant to an instruction given by the client under a custodial 
arrangement, the provider must give the client a Product Disclosure

subsection (3) of this section) to be given to the client by the 
regulated person before that acquisition occurred. For this purpose, 
an equivalent direct acquisition is an acquisition that would occur

to the client by the regulated person for the same price (or for 
the appropriate proportion of that price, if the transaction for

that they require the financial product to be acquired 
immediately, or by a specified time;
(b) if, because of subsection 1012G(2) as it applies because of 
paragraph (a) of this subsection, the provider does not have

the client under a custodial arrangement:
(i) subsection 1012G(2) applies in relation to the provider, 
the client and the regulated acquisition as if the 
obligation it imposes to comply with 
subsection 1012G(3) were imposed on the provider; and
(ii) subsection 1012G(3) applies in relation to the provider, 
the client and the regulated acquisition as if the 
reference to the regulated person were instead a 
reference to the provider, as if 
subparagraph 1012G(3)(b)(i) were omitted and as if the

paragraph (1)(c); and
(ii) 1 month to return the financial products and be repaid.
Note 1: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see 
subsection 1311(1)).
Note 2: If the responsible person chooses the option given by paragraph (aa) 
or (b), that option does not require the responsible person to wait until 
the end of the month referred to in subparagraph (aa)(ii) or (b)(ii) 
before going ahead and issuing or selling the financial products to the 
applicant if the applicant indicates before then that they still wish to 
proceed with the application.
Note 3: However, if the responsible person chooses the option given by 
paragraph (aa) or (b), whether the responsible person may go ahead 
and issue or sell the financial products to the applicant at the end of 
the month referred to in subparagraph (aa)(ii) or (b)(ii) (or earlier, as 
mentioned in note 2) is affected by this subsection and sections 1016A

subsections (2A) and (2B) of this section).
Note 4: If the responsible person chooses the option given by paragraph (c), 
sections 1016A to 1016D do not prohibit the issue or sale of the 
financial products under that paragraph (see subsection (2C) of this

Section 1016E
78 Corporations Act 2001
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(b) if:
(i) the reason for giving the new Product Disclosure 
Statement was that the responsible person became 
aware that the first Product Disclosure Statement was 
defective as at the time when it was prepared, or had 
become defective by the time the application was made; 
and
(ii) the financial products are relevant financial products as 
defined in section 1016A;
section 1016A applies in relation to the application, from the 
correction time, as if the first Product Disclosure Statement 
had instead contained the content of the new Product 
Disclosure Statement.
Note 1: Because of paragraph (a):
(a) if this section applies to the new Product Disclosure Statement, 
the responsible person’s ability to proceed to issue or sell the 
financial products pursuant to the application will be affected by 
subsection (2), and by sections 1016B, 1016C and 1016D, as 
those provisions apply in relation to the new Product Disclosure 
Statement (even though the application was actually made in 
response to the first Product Disclosure Statement); and
(b) sections 1016B, 1016C and 1016D, as they relate to the first 
Product Disclosure Statement, cease to apply in relation to the 
application.
Note 2: Because of paragraph (b), the application may be an eligible 
application as defined in section 1016A, even though the first Product 
Disclosure Statement was actually defective as at the time when the 
application was made.
(2B) If:
(a) in accordance with paragraph (2)(b), the responsible person 
gives the applicant a Supplementary Product Disclosure 
Statement that relates to the financial products; and
(b) the reason for giving the Supplementary Product Disclosure 
Statement was that the responsible person became aware that 
the first Product Disclosure Statement was defective as at the 
time when it was prepared, or had become defective by the 
time the application was made; and

section 1016A applies in relation to the application, from the time 
when the applicant is given the Supplementary Product Disclosure 
Statement, as if the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement 
had been given to the applicant before the application was made.
Note 1: Because of this subsection and section 1014D (information in a 
Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement is taken to be contained 
in the Product Disclosure Statement it supplements), the application 
may be an eligible application as defined in section 1016A, even 
though the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement was not 
actually given until after the time when the application was made.
Note 2: The responsible person’s ability to proceed to issue or sell the 
financial products pursuant to the application will be affected by 
subsection (2), and by sections 1016B, 1016C and 1016D, as those 
provisions apply in relation to the first Product Disclosure Statement 
as affected by the Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement and 
any other Supplementary Product Disclosure Statements.
(2BA) If Subdivision DA applies:
(a) for the purposes of subsection (2), instead of giving the 
applicant a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement, the 
responsible person may give the applicant a Replacement 
Product Disclosure Statement; and
(b) if the responsible person gives the applicant a Replacement 
Product Disclosure Statement, subsection (2B) applies as if 
references in that subsection to a Supplementary Product 
Disclosure Statement were references to the Replacement 
Product Disclosure Statement.
(2C) If the responsible person chooses to comply with paragraph (2)(c), 
nothing in sections 1016A to 1016D applies to the issue or sale of 
the financial products under that paragraph.
Note: This subsection affects the elements of the offences under 
sections 1016A to 1016D, and so it is not an exception in relation to 
which a defendant bears an evidential burden under subsection 13.3(3) 
of the Criminal Code.
(3) For the purpose of working out whether the condition referred to in 
paragraph (1)(a) has been satisfied, a person who has agreed to

(4) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(a) and (b), the relevant date in 
relation to an express or implied statement is:
(a) if the statement is express or implied in a Product Disclosure 
Statement, disregarding the effect of section 1014D—the 
date of the Product Disclosure Statement; or
(b) if the statement is express or implied in a Supplementary 
Product Disclosure Statement—the date of the 
Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement; or
(c) if the statement is express or implied in a Replacement 
Product Disclosure Statement (whether or not it is express or 
implied in the earlier Product Disclosure Statement it 
replaces)—the date of the Replacement Product Disclosure 
Statement.
(5) For the purposes of this section, defective, when used in relation to 
a Product Disclosure Statement at a particular time, means that the 
Product Disclosure Statement, if it had been given to a person at 
that time, would have been defective as defined in Subdivision A 
of Division 7.
Note: Information in a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement is taken 
to be contained in the Product Disclosure Statement it supplements 
(see section 1014D).
1016F  Remedies for person acquiring financial product under 
defective Product Disclosure Document

(1A) For the avoidance of doubt, if section 1012J (information must be 
up to date) is not complied with in relation to a Product Disclosure 
Statement, then, for the purposes of the definition of defective in 
subsection (1):
(a) if the circumstance constituting the non-compliance is that 
particular information included in the Product Disclosure 
Statement is not as up to date as section 1012J requires it to 
be—the information so included constitutes a misleading 
statement in the Product Disclosure Statement; and
(b) if the circumstance constituting the non-compliance is a 
failure to include particular information that was not 
previously required to be included in the Product Disclosure 
Statement—the failure to include the information constitutes 
an omission from the Statement of material required by 
section 1013C.
Note 1: The effect of section 1014D (information in a Supplementary Product 
Disclosure Statement is taken to be contained in the Product 
Disclosure Statement it supplements) must be taken into account in 
determining whether section 1012J is complied with in relation to a 
Product Disclosure Statement.
Note 2: Whether the inclusion of out of date information, or the failure to 
include information, results in the Product Disclosure Statement being 
defective as defined in subsection (1) depends on whether the 
materiality test set out in that definition is satisfied.
(2) In this Subdivision, a reference (including in the definitions in 
subsection (1)) to a document or statement, or to information, of a 
kind referred to in a paragraph of the definition of disclosure

Subdivision B—Civil liability
1022A  Meaning of defective and disclosure document or statement
(1) In this Subdivision:
defective, in relation to a disclosure document or statement, means:
(a) there is a misleading or deceptive statement in the disclosure 
document or statement; or
(b) if it is a Product Disclosure Statement—there is an omission 
from the Product Disclosure Statement of material required 
by section 1013C, other than material required by 
section 1013B or 1013G; or
(c) if it is a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement that is 
given for the purposes of section 1014E—there is an 
omission from the Supplementary Product Disclosure 
Statement of material required by that section; or
(d) if it is information required by paragraph 1012G(3)(a)—there 
is an omission from the information of material required by 
that paragraph; or
(e) if it is an offer document of a kind referred to in 
section 1019E—there is an omission from the document of 
material required by section 1019I; or
(f) if it is a supplementary offer document of a kind referred to 
in section 1019J—there is an omission from the document of 
material required by subsection 1019J(3).
Note: In determining whether a Product Disclosure Statement is defective, 
the effect of section 1014D must be taken into account (section 1014D 
takes information and statements in a Supplementary Product

disclosure document or statement means:
(a) a Product Disclosure Statement; or
(b) a Supplementary Product Disclosure Statement; or
(c) information required by paragraph 1012G(3)(a); or
(d) an offer document of a kind referred to in section 1019E; or
(e) a supplementary offer document of a kind referred to in 
section 1019J.
(1A) For the avoidance of doubt, if section 1012J (information must be 
up to date) is not complied with in relation to a Product Disclosure 
Statement, then, for the purposes of the definition of defective in 
subsection (1):
(a) if the circumstance constituting the non-compliance is that 
particular information included in the Product Disclosure 
Statement is not as up to date as section 1012J requires it to 
be—the information so included constitutes a misleading 
statement in the Product Disclosure Statement; and
(b) if the circumstance constituting the non-compliance is a 
failure to include particular information that was not 
previously required to be included in the Product Disclosure 
Statement—the failure to include the information constitutes 
an omission from the Statement of material required by 
section 1013C.
Note: The effect of section 1014D (information in a Supplementary Product 
Disclosure Statement is taken to be contained in the Product 
Disclosure Statement it supplements) must be taken into account in 
determining whether section 1012J is complied with in relation to a 
Product Disclosure Statement.
(2) In this Subdivision, a reference (including in the definitions in 
subsection (1)) to a document or statement, or to information, of a 
kind referred to in a paragraph of the definition of disclosure 
document or statement in subsection (1) includes a reference to 
something purporting to be a document or statement, or to be 
information, of that kind.

practicable, written notice of the information that the 
defendant has about:
(i) the identity of the other person; and
(ii) the circumstances that may make the other person a 
concurrent wrongdoer in relation to the claim; and

plaintiff cannot recover an amount of damages that, having regard 
to any damages previously recovered by the plaintiff in respect of

compensation for damage or loss that is greater than the damage or 
loss actually sustained by the plaintiff.

then (in addition to subsection (3)), the instrument is not a proper 
instrument of transfer for the purposes of subsection (2) unless it is 
a sufficient transfer of the securities under regulations made for the 
purposes of that Division.
(5) Subsection (2) does not prejudice the power of the company to 
register, as the holder of securities, a person to whom the right to 
the securities has devolved by will or by operation of law.
(6) Subsections (7) to (13) deal with a transfer of a security of a dead 
holder by the dead holder’s personal representative. They deal with 
the transfer differently depending on whether the personal 
representative is a local representative or not.
(7) The personal representative is a local representative if the 
representative is duly constituted as a personal representative under 
the law of the State or Territory in which the security is situated.
Note: Subsection 1070A(4) provides that the security is situated where the 
relevant register is kept.
(8) If the personal representative is a local representative, a transfer of 
the security by the representative is as valid as if the representative 
had been registered as the holder of the security at the time when 
the instrument of transfer was executed.
(9) If:
(a) the personal representative is not a local representative; and
(b) the representative:
(i) executes an instrument of transfer of the security to the 
representative or to another person; and
(ii) delivers the instrument to the company; and
(iii) delivers to the company with the instrument a statement 
in writing made by the representative to the effect that, 
to the best of the representative’s knowledge, 
information and belief, no grant of representation of the 
estate of the deceased holder has been applied for or

(c) the statement is made within 3 months immediately before 
the date on which the statement is delivered to the company;
the company must (subject to subsection (10)) register the transfer 
and pay to the representative any dividends or other money accrued 
in respect of the security up to the time when the instrument was 
executed.
(10) Subsection (9) does not operate so as to require the company to do 
anything that it would not have been required to do if the personal 
representative were a local representative.
(11) A transfer or payment made under subsection (9) and a receipt or 
acknowledgment of such a payment is, for all purposes, as valid 
and effectual as if the personal representative were a local 
representative.
(12) For the purposes of this section, an application by a personal 
representative of a dead person for registration as the holder of a 
security in place of the dead person is taken to be an instrument of 
transfer effecting a transfer of the security to the personal 
representative.
(13) The production to a company of a document that is, under the law 
of a State or Territory, sufficient evidence of probate of the will, or 
letters of administration of the estate, of a dead person having been 
granted to a person, is sufficient evidence of the grant (for the 
company’s purposes). This is so despite:
(a) anything in its constitution; or
(b) in a deed relating to debentures.

etc.
(1) A document transferring securities need not state the occupation of 
the transferor or transferee and, if it is signed by a person, the 
signature need not be witnessed.

1071D  Registration of transfer at request of transferor
(1) A written application by the transferor of a security of a company 
for the transferee’s name to be entered in the appropriate register is 
as effective (for the company’s purposes) as if it were an 
application by the transferee. The application is subject to the same 
conditions as it would be if it had been made by the transferee.
(2) If the transferor of a security of a company requests the company 
in writing to do so, the company must, by written notice, require a 
person who has possession, custody or control of either or both of 
the following:
(a) any title documents for the security;
(b) the instrument of transfer of the security;
to bring it or them into the office of the company within a specified 
period, to have the document cancelled or rectified and the transfer

them show prima facie title to the securities in the transferor 
named in the instrument of transfer; and
(b) is not taken as a representation that the transferor has any 
title to the securities.

1213E  Notified foreign passport funds to be treated as managed 
investment schemes
(1) A notified foreign passport fund is a managed investment scheme 
for the purposes of this Act, even if it would not otherwise be a 
managed investment scheme for the purposes of this Act because 
of the way in which that term is defined in section 9.
Note: This subsection does not affect the other legal characteristics of a 
notified foreign passport fund for the purposes of this Act. For 
example, if a notified foreign passport fund is a body corporate, it 
remains a body corporate for the purposes of this Act.

jurisdiction) for the notified foreign passport fund is taken to be the 
constitution of the fund as a managed investment scheme.

treated as companies etc.
To avoid doubt:
(a) neither the operator of a notified foreign passport fund nor 
the fund is to be treated as a company for the purposes of the 
corporations legislation, merely because the operator or the 
fund is registered as a foreign company under Division 2 of 
Part 5B.2; and
(b) a reference in the corporations legislation to a share does not 
include an interest in a notified foreign passport fund unless 
the fund is also a company.

Division 1—Shares
Subdivision A—Issuing and converting shares in a CCIV
1230  Shares can only be issued in respect of sub-funds
(1) A CCIV can issue a share only if the rights attaching to the share, 
so far as the rights are in respect of the assets of the CCIV, are 
restricted to rights in respect of the assets of one (and only one) 
sub-fund of the CCIV. This is the sub-fund to which the share is 
referable.
(2) The sub-fund to which the share is referable does not change if, 
after the share is issued, the CCIV acquires the share in respect of 
another of its sub-funds.
Note: For cross-investment between sub-funds, see Subdivision F.
(3) Subsection (1) and regulations made for the purposes of 
subsection (5) limit paragraph 124(1)(a) and section 254A in 
relation to a CCIV.
Note: Subsection (1) effectively also limits some other paragraphs of 
subsection 124(1), such as paragraph (c) (about granting options over 
unissued shares in a company).
(4) A Court must not make an order under section 254E that is 
inconsistent with subsection (1) of this section, or regulations made 
for the purposes of subsection (5) of this section, unless the Court 
considers that the interests of justice require otherwise.
(5) Regulations made for the purposes of this subsection may make 
provision for and in relation to further requirements for the issue of 
shares by a CCIV.

(d) a specified class of sub-funds of CCIVs;
(e) all sub-funds of a specified class of CCIVs.
1230A  Minimum of one class of shares per sub-fund
(1) The shares in a CCIV that are referable to the same sub-fund of the 
CCIV, if not divided into 2 or more classes, constitute a class.
Note: A CCIV can issue shares only if the rights attaching to the shares are 
referable to one (and only one) sub-fund of the CCIV: see 
section 1230.
(2) A class of shares is referable to a sub-fund of a CCIV if the shares 
in the class are referable to the sub-fund.
Part 2F.2 does not permit variation contrary to this section
(3) Nothing in Part 2F.2 permits rights attached to shares in a class of 
shares to be varied or cancelled in a manner that results in a 
contravention of this section.
1230B  Power to issue redeemable shares
(1) Subject to section 1230, a CCIV’s power under section 124 to issue 
shares includes the power to issue redeemable shares.

Option to redeem is not a preference
(5) In determining whether a share in a CCIV is a preference share, 
any rights attaching to shares in the CCIV with respect to 
redemption are to be disregarded.
Note: As a result, a CCIV may have ordinary shares that are redeemable as 
well as ordinary shares that are not redeemable. Preferences relating to 
redemption (including preferences relating to who has the option to 
redeem) are ignored in determining whether a share is a preference 
share.
1230C  Conversion of shares

Section 256A does not apply in relation to a CCIV.
1231A  CCIV may make reduction not otherwise authorised
(1) A CCIV may reduce its share capital in a way that is not otherwise 
authorised by law if:
(a) the reduction is permitted by the CCIV’s constitution; and
(b) immediately before the reduction:
(i) each sub-fund that the reduction affects is solvent; and
(ii) there are no reasonable grounds for suspecting that any 
sub-fund that the reduction affects would become 
insolvent immediately after the reduction; and
(c) the reduction complies with any requirements prescribed by 
regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.
Note: This Subdivision also deals with some other situations (such as share 
redemptions) in which reductions of share capital are authorised.
When a sub-fund is solvent and insolvent
(2) A sub-fund is solvent if, and only if, the CCIV is able to pay all the 
debts that are liabilities of the sub-fund, as and when they become 
due and payable.
Note: The liabilities of a sub-fund can only be met from assets of the 
sub-fund: see section 1234A.
(3) A sub-fund that is not solvent is insolvent.

reduction must be authorised by law.
Note: A share buy-back that involves a reduction of share capital will be 
authorised by law if, for example, the buy-back complies with 
subsection 1231A(1).
(3) If a CCIV has entered into an agreement to buy back shares, all 
rights attaching to the shares are suspended. The suspension is 
lifted if the agreement is terminated.

of sub-funds), are to be assets of the sub-fund; and
(b) do not include assets that, in accordance with an order made 
under that section, are no longer to be assets of the sub-fund.

trust.
(3) The corporate director of the CCIV must apply the item of property 
to obtain other money or fungible property, so as to achieve the 
result that, when subsection 1233H(1) is applied to the other 
money or property to determine the extent to which it forms part of 
the assets of the sub-funds, no single item of property forms part of 
the assets of 2 or more sub-funds.

Terms or expressions that have a particular meaning in relation to

(a) a term or expression has a particular meaning in this Act in 
relation to a sub-fund of a CCIV; and
(b) the term or expression occurs in a provision, in relation to a 
reference (including an implied reference) that is required by 
this Part to be substituted with a reference to a sub-fund;
then the meaning the term or expression has in relation to the 
sub-fund in the provision is the meaning referred to in

a provision of this Act in relation to a company, corporation 
or body corporate; and
(b) because of a reference (including an implied reference) that is 
required by this Part to be substituted with a reference to a 
sub-fund, it is necessary to determine the meaning of the 
term or expression in relation to a sub-fund of a CCIV; and
(c) the term or expression does not have a particular meaning in 
relation to a sub-fund of a CCIV;
then the meaning the term or expression has in relation to the 
sub-fund is the meaning the term or expression would have in 
relation to the CCIV if the CCIV had no other sub-funds.
Note: For example, the term related entity is defined in section 9 in relation 
to a body corporate, and is not defined in relation to a sub-fund of a 
CCIV. To determine whether a person is a related entity of a sub-fund:
(a) first, assume that the CCIV has no other sub-funds (this includes 
disregarding any shares held by the CCIV that are assets of other 
sub-funds of the CCIV); and
(b) then, apply the definition of related entity in section 9 to the 
CCIV based on that assumption.
As a result, a member of the CCIV (paragraph (d) of the definition of 
related entity) will only be a related entity of a sub-fund of the CCIV 
if the person is a member of the sub-fund.

in subsection 411(2) must state any material interests of the corporate 
director and of the directors of the corporate director.
(5) Despite item 1 of the table in subsection (4), a reference covered 
by column 1 of that item is taken to be a reference to the CCIV if 
the context of the reference so requires (for example, because the 
reference requires the legal capacity and powers of a company).
Note 1: For example, references to the Part 5.1 body, in the context of the 
body as a party to a compromise or arrangement, are references to the 
CCIV, because the CCIV is the legal person that is a party to, and that 
is bound by, the compromise or arrangement.
Note 2: For example, references to the Part 5.1 body, in the context of 
identifying a liquidator, are references to the sub-fund, because 
winding up of a CCIV takes place at the sub-fund level.
(6) If a reference in a provision to the relevant body is, as a result of 
subsection (5), taken to be a reference to the CCIV, the operation 
of the provision in relation to the CCIV is confined, to the extent 
possible, to the sub-fund.

The object of this Division is to preserve the segregated application 
of assets of sub-funds by requiring a separate winding up 
procedure for each sub-fund.
1237A  No winding up of a CCIV
A CCIV cannot be wound up, or placed in liquidation.
Note: If a CCIV has no sub-funds, ASIC must deregister the CCIV: see 
section 1239K.
Subdivision B—Application of winding up provisions to 
winding up of sub-funds
1237B  Applying winding up provisions to sub-funds
(1) An application to wind up a sub-fund of a CCIV, and the winding 
up of a sub-fund of a CCIV, are regulated:
(a) by the provisions of this Division; and
(b) by the winding up provisions referred to in subsection (2), 
applying, so far as they are capable of so doing, subject to:
(i) such modifications as are set out in this Division; and

8 refers to the incorporation of the

Note 1: Item 1—for example, in paragraph 459P(1)(b) there is an implied 
reference to “of the company” after “a creditor”, and in 
paragraph 459P(1)(c) there is an implied reference to “of the 
company” after “a contributory”. For a CCIV, both these implied 
references would be substituted with implied references to “of the 
sub-fund”.
Note 2: Item 4—for example, if the winding up of a sub-fund of a CCIV 
commences, section 468A will operate to void a transfer of shares in 
the CCIV only if the shares are referable to the sub-fund.

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Note 3: Item 7—for example, subsection 495(1) requires the members of the 
sub-fund to appoint a liquidator or liquidators.
(5) Despite item 1 of the table in subsection (4), a reference covered 
by column 1 of that item is taken to be a reference to the CCIV if 
the context of the reference so requires (for example, because the 
reference requires the legal capacity and powers of a company).
Note 1: For example, the references in paragraphs 459P(1)(a) and 462(2)(a) to 
“the company” are taken to be references to “the CCIV” because an 
application to the Court would be made by the legal person that is the 
CCIV.
Note 2: For example, the reference in subsection 461(2) to “A company must 
lodge” is taken to be a reference to “The CCIV must lodge” because 
the lodging of documents with ASIC would be done by the legal 
person that is the CCIV.
Note 3: For example, the reference in section 493 to the “corporate state and 
corporate powers of the company” is a reference to the “corporate 
state and corporate powers of the CCIV”.
(6) If a reference in a provision to the relevant company is, as a result 
of subsection (5), taken to be a reference to the CCIV, the 
operation of the provision in relation to the CCIV is confined, to 
the extent possible, to the sub-fund.
Note: For example, the first reference in paragraph 471B(a) to “the 
company” is a reference to the CCIV, because only a legal person can 
be a party to a proceeding in a court. However, the operation of 
section 471B to prevent proceedings against the CCIV is confined to 
proceedings that relate to the sub-fund.
1237C  References to debts etc. of a sub-fund
For the purposes of the application of the winding up provisions, as 
those provisions apply subject to item 1 of the table in 
subsection 1237B(4):
(a) a debt of the CCIV is taken to be a debt of a sub-fund to the 
extent (if any) that the debt is a liability of the sub-fund; and
(b) a claim against the CCIV is taken to be a claim against a 
sub-fund of the CCIV to the extent (if any) that the claim is a 
liability of the sub-fund.

Subdivision C—Winding up of a sub-fund in insolvency
1237D  When a sub-fund is presumed to be insolvent
Paragraph 459C(2)(a) is taken to be satisfied in relation to a 
sub-fund of a CCIV if:
(a) the CCIV failed (as defined by section 459F) to comply with 
a statutory demand; and
(b) the failure affects the sub-fund (see subsection 1237E(3)).
1237E  Statutory demand—creditor may serve demand on CCIV
(1) A person may serve a statutory demand on a CCIV under 
section 459E.
(2) However, subsection 459E(2) applies to a statutory demand served 
on a CCIV as if it also required the demand to specify, in relation 
to each debt to which the demand relates:
(a) the sub-fund or sub-funds of the CCIV of which the debt is a 
liability; and
(b) if the debt is a liability of 2 or more sub-funds of the CCIV—
the proportion of the debt allocated to each sub-fund at the 
time the demand is served.
(3) Whether a CCIV has failed to comply with a statutory demand is 
determined under section 459F. If the CCIV has failed to comply 
with a statutory demand, the failure affects each sub-fund specified 
in the demand.

(b) such other modifications as are made necessary by the facts 
that:
(i) for a CCIV, solvency and insolvency are determined at 
the level of a sub-fund, instead of at the level of the 
CCIV; and
(ii) the officers to whom the provisions are directed are the 
officers of the corporate director, instead of the officers 
of the CCIV.

(2) The provisions (the property recovery provisions) are as follows:
(a) Divisions 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Part 5.7B (other than a provision 
excluded by subsection (3));

by column 1 of that item is taken to be a reference to the CCIV if 
the context of the reference so requires (for example, because the 
reference requires the legal capacity and powers of a company).

of subsection (5), taken to be a reference to the CCIV, the 
operation of the provision in relation to the CCIV is confined, to 
the extent possible, to the sub-fund.

to the deregistration of a sub-fund of a CCIV.
Note: Subsection 601AD(1) does not apply in relation to the deregistration

reference to property of the sub-fund.
Note: For references to property of a sub-fund, see subsection 51F(3).
Books
(3) If a sub-fund of a CCIV is deregistered, the CCIV must keep the

The Commonwealth or ASIC may do an act on behalf of the CCIV 
of a deregistered sub-fund or the liquidator of the sub-fund if the 
Commonwealth or ASIC is satisfied that the CCIV or liquidator 
would be bound to do the act if the sub-fund had not been 
deregistered.
Note: This power is a general one and is not limited to acts in relation to 
property vested in the Commonwealth under subsection 601AD(1A), 
or ASIC under subsection 601AD(2). The Commonwealth or ASIC 
has all the powers that automatically flow from the vesting of property 
under that subsection (see subsections 601AD(3A) and (4)) and may 
exercise those powers whether or not the CCIV was bound to do so.
1239F  Claims against insurers in relation to deregistered sub-fund
A person may recover from the insurer of a CCIV an amount that 
was payable to the CCIV under the insurance contract if:
(a) a sub-fund of the CCIV is deregistered; and
(b) the CCIV has a liability to the person that was a liability of 
the sub-fund; and
(c) the insurance contract covered that liability immediately 
before the sub-fund was deregistered.
1239G  Reinstatement of a sub-fund
(1) The registration of a sub-fund of a CCIV may be reinstated under 
section 601AH as if the sub-fund were a company.
Note: Notice of the reinstatement must be given: see section 1239J.
(2) If the registration of a sub-fund of a CCIV is reinstated under 
section 601AH, the sub-fund is taken to have been registered 
throughout the period it was deregistered.
(3) The Court’s power to make an order under subsection 601AH(3) 
includes the power to make an order in relation to the following:
(a) the assets or liabilities of a sub-fund of a CCIV whose 
registration is reinstated;

security or other interest or claim, the CCIV takes the property 
subject to that interest or claim.
Note: The CCIV must allocate the property to the sub-fund in accordance 
with Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part 8B.5.
(5) Subsections 601AH(1A), (4), (4A) and (5) do not apply in relation 
to the reinstatement of the registration of a sub-fund of a CCIV.
Registration as an Australian passport fund not reinstated
(6) The reinstatement of the registration of a sub-fund of a CCIV does 
not result in the sub-fund’s registration as a passport fund under 
Part 8A.3 being reinstated, even if the sub-fund was an Australian 
passport fund immediately before its deregistration.
1239H  CCIV reinstated following reinstatement of a sub-fund
(1) If a CCIV is deregistered and:
(a) ASIC reinstates the registration of a sub-fund of the CCIV 
under subsection 601AH(1); or
(b) the Court makes an order that ASIC reinstate the registration 
of the sub-fund under subsection 601AH(2);
ASIC must also reinstate the registration of the CCIV.
Note: Notice of the reinstatement of the registration of the CCIV must be 
given: see section 1239J.
Effect of reinstatement
(2) If the registration of a CCIV is reinstated the CCIV is taken to have 
continued in existence as if it had not been deregistered.

also has the effect of reinstating, at the time the registration is 
reinstated, ASIC’s record, kept as part of the registration, of the 
company that is the corporate director or temporary corporate 
director of the CCIV.
Note: The company named in the record as the corporate director or

notice to the corporate director of the CCIV of the following:
(a) the reinstatement of the registration of the sub-fund;
(b) if as a result of reinstating the sub-fund the registration of the 
CCIV is also reinstated under section 1239H—the 
reinstatement of the registration of the CCIV.

Subject to subsection 1240H(6), in Chapter 6D, securities does not 
include a security in a CCIV.
1240H  Offering securities of a CCIV or sub-fund that does not exist
(1) A person must not offer securities of a CCIV that does not exist if 
the offer would give rise to an obligation to give a Product 
Disclosure Statement under Chapter 7 (as that Chapter applies to 
securities in a CCIV under Division 4 of Part 8B.7) if the CCIV did 
exist.
(2) A person must not offer securities of a CCIV that are referable to a 
sub-fund of the CCIV that has not been established if the offer 
would give rise to an obligation to give a Product Disclosure 
Statement under Chapter 7 (as that Chapter applies to securities in 
a CCIV under Division 4 of Part 8B.7) if the sub-fund were 
established.
Note 1: For when a sub-fund is established, see section 1222T.
Note 2: For when shares and debentures are referable to a sub-fund of a CCIV, 
see sections 1230 (for shares) and 1231N (for debentures).
(3) Subsections (1) and (2) apply even if it is proposed to incorporate 
the CCIV or register the sub-fund.
(4) In this section, securities has the same meaning as it has in 
Chapter 6D (apart from section 1240G).
(5) For the purposes of subsection (2), a security referred to in 
paragraph 95(c) or (d) is taken to be referable to the sub-fund of 
the CCIV to which the relevant security covered by 
paragraph 95(a) or (b) is, or would be, referable.
Note: For example, an option to acquire by way of issue a share in a CCIV 
(covered by paragraph 95(d)) is referable to the sub-fund of the CCIV 
to which the share (covered by paragraph 95(a)) is referable.

1241  Application of Chapter 7 to CCIVs
Chapter 7 applies to a CCIV subject to the modifications set out in 
this Division.
1241A  For Chapter 7, treat the corporate director as providing 
financial services etc. being provided by the CCIV
(1) This section applies to a provision of Chapter 7 that applies in 
relation to:
(a) a financial services licensee; or
(b) a financial service or a financial services business; or
(c) a matter prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this 
paragraph.
General rule
(2) For the purposes of that provision of Chapter 7:
(a) treat any conduct engaged in by, or on behalf of, a CCIV as 
also being engaged in by, or on behalf of, the corporate 
director of the CCIV; and
(b) treat any conduct relating to the CCIV that is engaged in by a 
person (other than the corporate director of the CCIV) as also 
being engaged in by that person in relation to the corporate 
director of the CCIV.
(3) In subsection (2), conduct means an act, an omission to perform an 
act or a state of affairs.
Exceptions
(4) If the CCIV issues a security in the CCIV, then subsection (2) does 
not treat the corporate director of the CCIV as also being the issuer 
of the security.

(a) a clearing and settlement facility; or
(b) a financial market;
subsection (2) does not treat the corporate director of the CCIV as 
also being a participant in relation to the facility or market.
(6) Subsection (2) does not apply in any circumstances prescribed by 
the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.
1241B  Certain licensing concepts do not apply to CCIVs
(1) Subsection 911A(1) (about the requirement to be licensed to carry 
on a financial services business) does not apply to a CCIV.
Note: That subsection will instead apply to the corporate director of the 
CCIV in relation to any financial services business carried on by the 
CCIV (see subsection 1241A(2)).
(2) Subsection 911B(1) (about requirements for providing financial 
services on behalf of another person) does not apply to a CCIV.
Note: This subsection confirms that the CCIV is not subject to extra 
requirements if it is viewed as providing financial services on behalf 
of its corporate director.
(3) For the purposes of Chapter 7, treat a CCIV as not being a 
representative of the corporate director of the CCIV.
Note: Activities of the CCIV relating to a financial service etc. are instead 
treated as activities of the corporate director (see 
subsection 1241A(2)).
(4) For the purposes of Chapter 7, a CCIV cannot be authorised under 
Division 5 (about authorised representatives of licensees) of 
Part 7.6.
Note: Activities of the CCIV relating to a financial service etc. are instead 
treated as activities of the corporate director (see 
subsection 1241A(2)).

providing that a person provides a financial service if:
(a) the person operates the business and conducts the affairs of a 
CCIV; and
(b) the person is the corporate director of the CCIV.
Note: Subsection (1) means persons other than the corporate director will 
not be treated as providing that financial service if they operate the 
business and conduct the affairs of the CCIV while:
(a) acting as an agent of the CCIV, or as an agent or employee of the 
corporate director; or
(b) taking steps to wind up the CCIV.
(2) For the purposes of Chapter 7, each of the members of a CCIV 
covered by subsection (1) is a client for the financial service 
covered by that subsection.
1241D  CCIV buy-back or redemption facility does not make a 
market
Subsection 766D(1) does not apply to a CCIV, nor to the corporate 
director of a CCIV, for:
(a) a proposed buy-back by the CCIV; or
(b) the proposed issuing or redeeming by the CCIV of:
(i) redeemable shares in the CCIV; or
(ii) redeemable preference shares in the CCIV.

custodial or depository service
Treat subsection 766E(3) as also providing that none of the 
following conduct constitutes providing a custodial or depository 
service:
(a) operating as a CCIV;
(b) operating the business and conducting the affairs of a CCIV;
(c) holding the money or property of a CCIV.

1241F  Australian financial services licences
(1) For the purposes of Chapter 7, a single Australian financial 
services licence can cover operating the business and conducting 
the affairs of more than one CCIV.
Note: This confirms that a corporate director of several CCIVs could be 
granted a single licence to operate the business and conduct the affairs 
of those CCIVs.
(2) Treat subsection 911A(4) as also providing that a person is not 
exempt under any paragraph of subsection 911A(2) for a financial 
service they provide if:
(a) the service is operating the business and conducting the 
affairs of a CCIV; and
(b) the person is the corporate director of the CCIV.
(3) Despite paragraph 912A(4)(b), paragraph 912A(1)(d) also applies

(4) Despite subsection 912A(5), paragraph 912A(1)(h) also applies to 
an RSE licensee that is the corporate director of a CCIV, except to 
the extent that the risk relates solely to the operation of a regulated 
superannuation fund by the RSE licensee.
(5) Treat subsection 912D(4) as also providing that, for the purposes 
of section 912D, a breach of a core obligation is taken to be 
significant in the case of a CCIV if the breach results, or is likely 
to result, in material loss or damage to a member of members of 
the CCIV.
1241G  Immediate suspensions or cancellations of licences
Treat subsection 915B(3) as also providing that ASIC may suspend 
or cancel an Australian financial services licence held by a body 
corporate, by giving written notice to the body, if:

Treat subsection 923A(1) as also providing that a CCIV 
contravenes that subsection if the CCIV assumes or uses, in this 
jurisdiction, a restricted word or expression in relation to a 
financial services business or financial service.
1241J  Agreements with certain unlicensed persons
(1) Subdivision B of Division 11 of Part 7.6 also applies to an 
agreement entered into by:
(a) a CCIV (in that Subdivision called the non-licensee); and
(b) another person (in that Subdivision called the client) who is 
not a financial services licensee;
that constitutes, or relates to, the provision of a financial service by 
the corporate director of the CCIV (in that Subdivision called the 
corporate director) if:
(c) the agreement is entered into in the course of a financial 
services business carried on by the corporate director; and
(d) the corporate director does not hold an Australian financial 
services licence covering the provision of the financial 
service; and
(e) the corporate director is not exempt from the requirement to 
hold such a licence.
Note 1: A CCIV does not need to be licensed to provide a financial service, 
instead the CCIV’s corporate director needs to be (see 
subsection 1241B(1)). This means section 924A will work 
appropriately only if the agreement mentioned in that section is 
between the corporate director and the client.
Note 2: This section works similarly to section 924A to ensure that the 
appropriate result happens if the agreement mentioned in 
section 924A is instead between the CCIV and the client.
Note 3: This section applies whether the financial service is provided to the 
client as a wholesale client or as a retail client.

the client that the licence was suspended, the non-licensee is to be 
taken for the purposes of subsection (4) to have informed the client 
at that time that the corporate director did not hold the licence.”.

subsection 992A(1) does not apply to the offering of securities in a 
CCIV, hawking of which is prohibited by section 992AA (as 
extended by this section).
(2) Subsection 992AA(1) also applies as if the reference in that 
subsection to interests in managed investment schemes included a 
reference to securities in a CCIV.
Note: Failure to comply with subsection 992AA(1) is an offence (see 
subsection 1311(1)).
(3) Subsection 992AA(1), as it applies because of subsection (2) of 
this section, does not apply to an offer of securities in a CCIV if:
(a) the offer is not to a retail client; or
(b) the CCIV is a listed company and the offer is an offer of 
securities in the CCIV made by telephone by a financial 
services licensee; or
(c) the offer is made to a client by a financial services licensee

a reference to inviting an application for the issue of 
securities in the CCIV; and
(b) a reference to offering securities in a CCIV for sale includes 
a reference to inviting an offer to purchase securities in the 
CCIV.

(1) Paragraph 994B(3)(d) (about an exception to making a target 
market determination for a financial product) does not apply to a 
fully paid ordinary share in a CCIV.
(2) If a contravention referred to in paragraph 994M(1)(a) is a 
contravention by a CCIV, subsection 994M(1) applies to authorise 
recovery by action against the CCIV’s corporate director instead of 
against the CCIV.
Note: Subsection 994M(1) authorises a client to recover the amount of loss 
or damage suffered because of certain contraventions.
1241Q  Part 7.9 applies to the issue or sale of securities in a CCIV
(1) Despite subsection 1010A(1), Part 7.9 applies to securities in a 
CCIV.
Note: This and other sections in this Part extend and modify how Part 7.9 
applies for a CCIV. A consequence is that, for a CCIV, references 
outside of Part 7.9 to provisions of Part 7.9 become references to those 
provisions as they apply because of this Part.
(2) Despite subsection 1010B(1), Part 7.9 applies in relation to the 
issue of any security in a CCIV.
(3) If the corporate director of a CCIV is, apart from this subsection, a 
regulated person (within the meaning of Division 2 of Part 7.9) 
because it is the seller of a security in the CCIV, treat the CCIV as 
being the regulated person within the meaning of that Division 
instead of the corporate director.
Note 1: The corporate director of the CCIV will continue to be a regulated 
person for any other case.
Note 2: The CCIV will also be the regulated person for an issue of securities 
in the CCIV (see subsection 1241A(4) and section 1011B).

For the purposes of sections 1012C and 1012D (as affected by this 
Part), a security in a CCIV that is referable to a sub-fund of the 
CCIV is of the same kind as another product only if the other 
product:

(b) is also referable to that sub-fund of the CCIV; and
(c) is issued on the same terms and conditions (other than price)
