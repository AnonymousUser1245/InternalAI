(7) This is how to work out a disclosing entity’s market capitalisation 
on the relevant day:
(a) for each class of security of the disclosing entity that is a 
quoted security:
(i) work out the closing price, on the relevant day, for 
securities in that class on the declared financial market 
on which the securities are quoted; and

class on issue on the relevant day (as shown in the 
financial report lodged with ASIC for the period that 
ends on the relevant day); and
(b) add up the amounts obtained under paragraph (a): the result 
is the disclosing entity’s market capitalisation on the relevant

Part 10.1—Transition from the old corporations

Division 1—Preliminary
1370  Object of Part
(1) Subject to subsection (3), the object of this Part is to provide for a 
smooth transition from the regime provided for in the old 
corporations legislation of the States and Territories in this 
jurisdiction to the regime provided for in the new corporations 
legislation, so that individuals, bodies corporate and other bodies 
are, to the greatest extent possible, put in the same position 
immediately after the commencement as they would have been if:
(a) that old corporations legislation had, from time to time when 
it was in force, been valid Commonwealth legislation 
applying throughout those States and Territories; and
(b) the new corporations legislation (to the extent it contains 
provisions that correspond to provisions of the old 
corporations legislation as in force immediately before the 
commencement) were a continuation of that old corporations 
legislation as so applying.
Note: The new corporations legislation contains provisions that correspond 
to most of the provisions of the old corporations legislation. 
Generally, the only exceptions to this are provisions of the old 
corporations legislation that related to the fact that the Corporations 
Law operated separately in each of the States and Territories (rather 
than as a single national law).
(2) In resolving any ambiguity as to the meaning of any of the other 
provisions of this Part, an interpretation that is consistent with the 
object of this Part is to be preferred to an interpretation that is not 
consistent with that object.

circumstances that made the authority’s or officer’s action an 
invalid administrative action had not made the action invalid.

Division 1  Preliminary
Section 1372
262 Corporations Act 2001
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Note 1: So, for example, in determining whether the purported registration of 
a company is an action to which this Part (in particular Division 2) 
applies, the circumstances that made the action an invalid 
administrative action for the purposes of a State validation Act are to 
be disregarded.
Note 2: For the status and effect of invalid administrative actions in relation to 
times before the commencement, see the State validation Acts.
(2) However, if there are other circumstances that affect or may affect 
the validity of the action, neither this section, nor anything else in 
this Part, is taken to negate the effect of those other circumstances.
(3) If:
(a) a person would have had a right or liability under a provision 
(the old provision) of the old corporations legislation of a 
State if the circumstances that made the authority’s or 
officer’s action an invalid administrative action (within the 
meaning of the State validation Act of that State) had not 
made the action invalid; and
(b) the effect of that State validation Act in relation to that action 
is to declare that the person has, and is taken always to have 
had, the same rights and liabilities as they would have had 
under the old provision if the invalid administrative action 
had been taken, or purportedly taken, at the relevant time by 
a duly authorised State authority or officer of the State 
(within the meaning of that Act);
this Part applies as if:
(c) a reference to a right or liability arising under the old 
corporations legislation included a reference to the right or 
liability that the person is declared to have by the State 
validation Act; and
(d) that right or liability arose under the old provision.
(4) In this section:
State validation Act means an Act of a State in this jurisdiction 
under which certain administrative actions (within the meaning of 
that Act) taken, or purportedly taken, at or before the 
commencement by Commonwealth authorities or officers of the

or officer of the State (within the meaning of that Act); and
(b) the relevant functions or powers had been duly conferred on 
those authorities or officers.
1373  References to things taken or deemed to be the case etc.
If:
(a) a law of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction had effect 
before the commencement:
(i) to take or deem something to have happened or to be the 
case, or to have a particular effect, under or for the 
purposes of the old corporations legislation of that State 
or Territory (or a provision of that legislation); or
(ii) to give something an effect for the purposes of the old 
corporations legislation of that State or Territory (or a 
provision of that legislation) that it would not otherwise 
have had; and
(b) that effect was continuing immediately before the 
commencement;
this Part applies as if that thing had actually happened or were 
actually the case, or as if that thing actually had that other effect.
Note: So, for example, if a provision of the old corporations legislation, or 
another law, of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction took a company 
to be registered under Part 2A.2 of the old Corporations Law of the 
State or Territory, this Part applies as if the company were actually 
registered under that Part.

If, apart from this section, a provision of this Part (the transitional 
provision) would, because each State or Territory in this 
jurisdiction had its own old corporations legislation (containing 
parallel provisions) before the commencement, operate so that:
(a) a particular thing done before the commencement would be 
taken to be done, or have effect, 2 or more times by, under or 
for the purposes of, a provision of this Act; or
(b) a right or liability would be created 2 or more times in 
respect of a particular event, circumstance or thing that 
happened before the commencement; or
(c) a particular result or effect would be produced 2 or more 
times for the purposes of the new corporations legislation in 
relation to the same matter;
the transitional provision is taken to operate so that:
(d) if paragraph (a) applies—the thing is taken to be done or 
have effect only once by, under, or for the purposes of, the 
provision of the new corporations legislation; or
(e) if paragraph (b) applies—the right or liability is created only 
once in respect of the event, circumstance or thing; or
(f) if paragraph (c) applies—the result or effect is produced only 
once in relation to the matter.
Note: So, for example, if a body (because of the operation of section 102A 
of the old Corporations Law) was registered under section 601CB of 
the old Corporations Law of several States and Territories and those 
registrations were still in force immediately before the 
commencement, section 1399 does not apply separately to each of 
those registrations.

(1) Subject to subsection (4), this section applies in relation to a right 
or liability (the pre-commencement right or liability), whether 
civil or criminal, that:
(a) was:
(i) acquired, accrued or incurred under a carried over 
provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or 
Territory in this jurisdiction; and
(ii) in existence immediately before the commencement; or
(b) would have been:
(i) acquired, accrued or incurred under such a provision; 
and
(ii) in existence immediately before the commencement;
if every agreement that was valid only because of section 249 
of the ASIC Act had been a valid agreement without the 
application of that section.
However, this section does not apply to a right or liability under an 
order made by a court before the commencement.
(2) On the commencement, the person acquires, accrues or incurs a 
right or liability (the substituted right or liability), equivalent to 
the pre-commencement right or liability, under the corresponding 
provision of the new corporations legislation (as if that provision 
applied to the conduct or circumstances that gave rise to the 
pre-commencement right or liability).
Note: If a time limit applied in relation to the pre-commencement right or 
liability under the old corporations legislation, that same time limit 
(calculated from the same starting point) will apply under the new 
corporations legislation to the substituted right or liability—see 
subsection 1402(3).
(3) A procedure, proceeding or remedy in respect of the substituted 
right or liability may be instituted after the commencement under 
the new corporations legislation (as if that provision applied to the

(4) If, immediately before the commencement, a person had an 
accrued right to make a claim under a provision of Part 7.10 of the 
old Corporations Law of a State that is not a referring State (and so 
is not in this jurisdiction), this section applies in relation to that 
right in the same way as it would have applied if the State had been 
a referring State.
Note: Except to the extent provided in this subsection, this Part does not 
create rights and liabilities that are equivalent to those that existed 
under the old corporations legislation of a non-referring State.
(5) This section does not apply to a pre-commencement right or 
liability that:
(a) existed under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or 
Territory; and

because of section 249 of the ASIC Act had been a valid 
agreement without the application of that section.

(including any appeals) had not been finally determined as at 
that day.
(7) Nothing in paragraph (1)(b) or subsection (5) or (6) limits the 
operation of section 249 of the ASIC Act.

(3) On the commencement, the person acquires, accrues or incurs a 
right or liability (the substituted right or liability), equivalent to

Section 1402
Corporations Act 2001 293
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/20251402  Old corporations legislation time limits etc.
(1) An old corporations legislation time limit (see subsection (4)):
(a) the starting point of which:
(i) was known or had been determined before the 
commencement (whether that starting point occurred or 
would occur before, on or after the commencement); or
(ii) would have become known, or have been determined, 
after the commencement if the old corporations 
legislation of the relevant State or Territory had 
continued to apply (whether that starting point would 
have occurred before, on or after the commencement); 
and
(b) that had not ended at or before the commencement;
continues to run, or starts or started to run, as if that same time 
limit (starting from the same starting point) were applicable under 
the new corporations legislation.
(2) If:
(a) under the old corporations legislation, a process (for 
example, the winding up of a company), a status of a person 
or body (for example, a body’s registration as a company or a 
person’s status as a registered liquidator), or an instrument, 
commenced from a particular time before the 
commencement; and
(b) that process, status or instrument is continued after the 
commencement for the purposes of the new corporations 
legislation by a provision of this Part;
that process, status or instrument as so continued is still taken to 
have commenced from the time referred to in paragraph (a).
(3) If an old corporations legislation time limit related to a 
pre-commencement right or liability, the same time limit applies in 
relation to the substituted right or liability.
(4) In this section:
old corporations legislation time limit includes:

under a provision of the old corporations legislation of a 
State or Territory; or
(b) a period specified or determined under a provision of the old 
corporations legislation of a State or Territory as the duration 
of a particular instrument or status.
1403  Preservation of significance etc. of events or circumstances
(1) An event, circumstance or other thing:
(a) that occurred or arose before the commencement under or as 
mentioned in a provision of the old corporations legislation 
of a State or Territory in this jurisdiction; and
(b) that had a particular significance, status or effect for the 
purposes of a carried over provision of that legislation 
(including because of an interpretive provision);
has that same significance, status and effect after the 
commencement for the purposes of the provision of the new 
corporations legislation that corresponds to that carried over 
provision.
Note: So, for example:
(a) if a company took action before the commencement that had the 
result for the purposes of section 200B of the old Corporations 
Law of making a superannuation fund a prescribed 
superannuation fund in relation to the company, that action has 
that same effect for the purposes of section 200B of this Act; and
(b) a delay that could have been taken into account for the purposes 
of subsection 874(1) of the old Corporations Law also counts for 
the purposes of subsection 874(1) of this Act.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), an event, circumstance or other 
thing had a particular significance for the purposes of a carried 
over provision of the old corporations legislation of a State or 
Territory in this jurisdiction if:
(a) the carried over provision created an obligation in respect of 
the event, circumstance or thing (whenever it arose); or
(b) the carried over provision provided for the event, 
circumstance or thing to be dealt with in a particular way; or

or thing (whenever it arose) was to be disregarded for the 
purposes of that provision or was not covered by that 
provision.
1404  References in the new corporations legislation generally 
include references to events, circumstances or things that 
happened or arose before the commencement
(1) Subject to this section, a reference in the new corporations 
legislation to an event, circumstance or thing of a particular kind 
that happens or arises, or that has happened or arisen, is taken to 
include a reference to an event, circumstance or thing of that kind 
that happened or arose at a time before the commencement, unless 
a contrary intention is expressed. The fact that the provision uses 
only the present tense in referring to an event, circumstance or 
thing is not, of itself, to be regarded as an expression of a contrary 
intention.
Note: So, for example, if a provision of the new corporations legislation 
refers to a person who consents to a course of action, that reference (in 
the absence of an express provision to the contrary) will not be limited 
to consents given after the commencement and will cover a consent 
given before the commencement.
(2) Nothing in subsection (1) is taken to produce a result that a right or 
liability exists under a provision of the new corporations legislation 
that relates solely to events, circumstances or things that occurred 
before the commencement.
Note: Instead, an equivalent right or liability will be created by section 1400 
or 1401.
(3) The regulations may provide that subsection (1) does not apply in 
relation to a particular reference or class of references in the new 
corporations legislation.

1406  Carrying over references to corresponding previous laws
(1) If a carried over provision of the old corporations legislation of a 
State or Territory in this jurisdiction contained a reference 
(whether in its own terms or by operation of another provision) to:
(a) a corresponding previous law (as defined for the purposes of 
that provision or provisions including that provision); or
(b) a thing done by, under, or for the purposes of, such a law;
the corresponding provision of the new corporations legislation is 
taken to contain an equivalent reference to that previous law, or to 
such a thing done by, under, or for the purposes of, that previous 
law.
(2) The following references in the old corporations legislation of the 
States and Territories in this jurisdiction are covered by 
subsection (1) in the same way as they would be if they used the 
“corresponding previous law” form of words:
(a) the reference in subsection 1274AA(1) to a “previous Law”;
(b) the reference in subparagraph 1274AA(2)(b)(ii) to a 
“previous law of this jurisdiction before the commencement 
of this Part that corresponds”;

(2) Without limiting subsection (1) (but subject to subsection (3)), if a 
transitional provision of the old Corporations Law of a State or

Subdivision B—Treatment of existing markets
1411  When is a market being operated immediately before the FSR 
commencement?
Subject to section 1412, in this Subdivision, a reference to a market 
being operated immediately before the FSR commencement is a 
reference to a market that had not permanently ceased to operate 
before the FSR commencement, even if trading on the market was 
not actually occurring immediately before the FSR commencement 
(for example, because of a routine temporary closure of the 
market).
1412  Treatment of proposed markets that have not started to 
operate by the FSR commencement
(1) This section applies in relation to the following proposed markets, 
other than any such market that starts to operate before the FSR 
commencement:

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(a) a market proposed to be operated by Bendigo Stock 
Exchange Ltd, or by ASX Futures Exchange Pty Limited, 
that is identified in writing by the Minister as being a 
proposed market to which this section applies;
(b) any other proposed market identified in, or in accordance 
with, regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.
For this purpose, a proposed market is a market that a person has, 
before the FSR commencement, indicated an intention that they 
propose to operate.
(2) This Subdivision applies in relation to a proposed market to which 
this section applies subject to the following paragraphs:
(a) subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), this Subdivision applies 
in relation to the proposed market as if the market, as 
proposed to be operated, were in fact being operated 
immediately before the FSR commencement;
(b) if, taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), section 1413 
applies in relation to the proposed market, that section 
applies in relation to the proposed market:
(i) as if the Minister’s obligation to grant a licence, and 
impose conditions, under subsection 1413(2) in relation 
to the market does not arise unless and until the market 
operator lodges with ASIC a notice in relation to the 
market under subsection (3) of this section, and does not 
arise at all if no such notice is given to ASIC by the end 
of 6 months after the FSR commencement; and
(ii) as if subsection 1413(3) provided for a licence so 
granted under subsection 1413(2) in relation to the 
market, and the conditions subject to which it is granted, 
to be taken to have had effect from the day (the start 
day) specified in the subsection (3) notice as the day on 
which the market started to operate; and
(iii) as if subsection 1413(6) were omitted; and
(iv) as if the references in subsection 1413(8) to the FSR 
commencement were instead references to the start day;
(c) if:

proposed market; and
(ii) the market operator does not lodge with ASIC a notice 
in relation to the market under subsection (3) of this 
section by the end of 6 months after the FSR 
commencement;
that section ceases to apply in relation to the proposed market 
at the end of that period;
(d) if a provision of this Subdivision provides for a provision of 
the old Corporations Act to continue to apply in relation to 
the proposed market, then (without limiting the generality of 
subsection 1410(3)), while the proposed market remains 
non-operational, the provision of the old Corporations Act 
only applies in relation to the proposed market to the extent 
(if any) to which it would, disregarding the effect of 
paragraph (a), apply in relation to the proposed market.
(3) If a proposed market to which this section applies starts to operate 
on a day during the period of 6 months starting on the FSR 
commencement, the operator must, as soon as practicable, and in 
any event within 7 days, lodge with ASIC written notice of the fact 
that the market started to operate on that day.
Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see 
subsection 1311(1)).
(4) ASIC must, within a reasonable time, give the Minister a notice it 
receives under subsection (3).

be granted must be granted on, or as soon as practicable after, the 
FSR commencement. If it is granted after the FSR commencement,

have had effect from that commencement.

795E (more than one market covered by the same licence) of the 
amended Corporations Act apply in relation to the granting of 
licences, and licences granted, under this section as if the licences

(6) Despite anything in subsection (3), the Minister may, under this 
section, grant a licence, and impose conditions on the licence, at 
any time during the period starting on the commencement of this 
section and ending on the FSR commencement on the basis that 
matters known to the Minister in relation to the market concerned 
will continue to be the case up to the FSR commencement. If the 
Minister does so:
(a) the licence and conditions come into effect on the FSR 
commencement, and not before; and
(b) the Minister may vary or revoke the licence, or any of the 
conditions, before the FSR commencement if the Minister 
considers it appropriate to do so having regard to the 
provisions of this section concerning the granting of licences 
and the imposition of conditions; and

financial products that can be dealt with on the market, the 
classes of financial products specified in whichever of 
paragraphs 1413(5)(a) and (b) is applicable; and
(c) immediately before the commencement, other financial 
products (the additional products) were also dealt with on 
the market, and the fact that the market dealt with those 
products did not constitute a contravention of a provision of 
the old Corporations Act.
(2) Subject to subsection (3), section 791A of the amended 
Corporations Act does not apply in relation to the market in so far 
as all or any of the additional products are dealt with on the market

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025the FSR commencement is a reference to a clearing and settlement 
facility that had not permanently ceased to operate before the FSR 
commencement, even if the clearing and settlement of transactions 
by means of the facility was not actually occurring immediately 
before the FSR commencement (for example, because of a routine 
temporary closure of the facility).
1424  Treatment of proposed clearing and settlement facilities that 
have not started to operate by the FSR commencement
(1) This section applies in relation to any proposed clearing and 
settlement facilities identified in, or in accordance with, regulations 
made for the purposes of this subsection. For this purpose, a 
proposed clearing and settlement facility is a clearing and 
settlement facility that a person has, before the FSR 
commencement, indicated an intention that they propose to 
operate.
(2) This Subdivision applies in relation to a proposed clearing and 
settlement facility to which this section applies subject to the 
following paragraphs:
(a) subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), this Subdivision applies 
in relation to the proposed facility as if the facility, as 
proposed to be operated, were in fact being operated 
immediately before the FSR commencement;
(b) if, taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), section 1425 
applies in relation to the proposed facility, that section 
applies in relation to the proposed facility:
(i) as if the Minister’s obligation to grant a licence, and 
impose conditions, under subsection 1425(2) in relation 
to the proposed facility does not arise unless and until 
the facility operator lodges with ASIC a notice in 
relation to the facility under subsection (3) of this 
section, and does not arise at all if no such notice is 
given to ASIC by the end of 6 months after the FSR 
commencement; and

(iii) as if subsection 1425(6) were omitted; and

commencement were instead references to the start day;
(c) if:
(i) taking account of the effect of paragraph (a), 
section 1429 applies to the proposed facility; and
(ii) the facility operator does not lodge with ASIC a notice 
in relation to the facility under subsection (3) of this 
section by the end of 6 months after the FSR 
commencement;
that section ceases to apply in relation to the proposed facility 
at the end of that period;
(d) if a provision of this Subdivision provides for a provision of 
the old Corporations Act to continue to apply in relation to 
the proposed facility, then (without limiting the generality of 
subsection 1410(3)), while the proposed facility remains 
non-operational, the provision of the old Corporations Act 
only applies in relation to the proposed facility to the extent 
(if any) to which it would, disregarding the effect of 
paragraph (a), apply in relation to the proposed facility.
(3) If a proposed clearing and settlement facility to which this section 
applies starts to operate on a day during the period of 6 months 
starting on the FSR commencement, the operator must, as soon as 
practicable, and in any event within 7 days, lodge with ASIC 
written notice of the fact that the facility started to operate on that 
day.
Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see 
subsection 1311(1)).

1424A  Treatment of unregulated clearing and settlement facilities 
operated by holders of old Corporations Act approvals
(1) This section applies in relation to a clearing and settlement facility 
if:
(a) the facility was being operated immediately before the FSR 
commencement by a body corporate in relation to which an 
approval under section 1131 of the old Corporations Act was 
in force at that time; but
(b) the services provided by the facility as so operated were not 
such that section 1128 of the old Corporations Act required 
the operator to be so approved.
(2) In this section:
(a) a reference to the unregulated services is a reference to the 
services referred to in paragraph (1)(b); and
(b) a reference to regulated services is a reference to services 
that, if they had been provided by the facility immediately 
before the commencement, would have been services to 
which section 1128 of the old Corporations Act applied.
(3) For the purposes of section 1425 (as it operates of its own force, 
rather than because of section 1424), the facility is not to be 
regarded as a facility that was being operated immediately before 
the FSR commencement.
(4) If the operator has, before the FSR commencement, indicated an 
intention that they propose to extend the services provided by the 
facility so that they also cover regulated services:
(a) regulations made for the purposes of subsection 1424(1) may 
identify the facility as a proposed clearing and settlement 
facility, but only in relation to those regulated services; and
(b) if they do so, section 1424, and section 1425 as it applies 
because of section 1424, apply in relation to the facility and

which either of the following paragraphs applies:
(a) the facility was being operated by the body corporate that 
was, for the purposes of the old Corporations Act, the 
securities clearing house;
(b) the facility was being operated by a body corporate in 
relation to which an approval (the section 1131 approval) 
under section 1131 of the old Corporations Act was in force 
at that time.
(2) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the Minister must, in relation to 
each clearing and settlement facility to which this section applies, 
grant the operator of the facility a licence, and impose conditions 
on that licence, in accordance with the following requirements:
(a) the licence must be described as an Australian CS facility 
licence;
(b) the licence must be granted subject to the following 
conditions:
(i) a condition specifying the facility as the facility that the 
licence authorises the licensee to operate;
(ii) a condition specifying, as the classes of financial 
products in respect of which the facility can provide 
services, the classes that are appropriate for the facility 
under subsection (5);
(iii) in the case of a facility to which paragraph (1)(b) 
applies—a condition to the effect that the licence only 
covers the facility providing services for the market or 
markets that were covered by the section 1131 approval.

Subdivision applies separately in relation to the person in their 
capacity as a regulated principal of each of those kinds.
Note: This may result (depending on what action the regulated principal 
takes) in a regulated principal having to comply with the relevant new

their activities as a regulated principal of one kind, but, at the same 
time, having to comply with the relevant old legislation in respect of 
their activities as a regulated principal of another kind.
1431  Parts 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 of the amended Corporations Act 
generally do not apply to a regulated principal during the 
transition period
(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), Parts 7.6 (other than 
Subdivisions A and B of Division 4, and Division 5), 7.7 and 7.8 
(other than section 992A) of the amended Corporations Act (the 
relevant new legislation) do not apply to a regulated principal and 
their regulated activities during the period (the transition period) 
starting on the FSR commencement and ending when the first of 
the following events occurs:

ends;
(b) the regulated principal is granted a licence under 
section 913B of the amended Corporations Act that covers 
their regulated activities;
(c) the regulated principal starts to be covered by an exemption 
under subsection 911A(2) of the amended Corporations Act 
(or would start to be so covered if that subsection applied) in 
respect of their regulated activities;
(d) the regulated principal ceases (for whatever reason) to have 
the status that made them a regulated principal.
For the purposes of paragraph (d), having a status includes holding 
a licence, registration, approval or other similar thing, or carrying 
on particular activities.

(2) Division 5 of Part 7.6 of the amended Corporations Act has effect 
in relation to a regulated principal during the transition period 
subject to the following paragraphs:
(a) the regulated principal may give and revoke authorisations 
under section 916A or consents under subsection 916B(3) as 
if the regulated principal were a financial services licensee, 
however, for the purposes of the provisions of the amended 
Corporations Act outside that Division, such an authorisation 
or consent is taken not to have effect unless and until the 
regulated principal is granted a licence under section 913B of 
the amended Corporations Act that covers the activities to 
which the authorisation or consent relates (whether or not it 
also covers other activities);
(b) a person authorised by a section 916A authorisation so made 
by the regulated principal may give and revoke authorisations 
under subsection 916B(3) as if they were an authorised 
representative and the regulated principal were the 
authorising financial services licensee, however, for the 
purposes of the provisions of the amended Corporations Act 
outside that Division, such an authorisation is taken not to 
have effect unless and until the regulated principal is granted 
a licence under section 913B of the amended Corporations 
Act that covers the activities to which the authorisation 
relates (whether or not it also covers other activities);
(c) the regulated principal may give and revoke consents under 
section 916C as if they were a financial service licensee, 
however, any such consent does not take effect unless and 
until the regulated principal is granted a licence under 
section 913B of the amended Corporations Act;
(d) section 916F applies in relation to an authorisation so made 
by the regulated principal during the transition period as if 
the period of 15 business days referred to in 
subsections 916F(1) and (1A) did not start unless and until

(3) If, before paragraph (1)(a) or (d) occurs:

some only (the relevant part) of their regulated activities; or
(b) the regulated principal starts to be covered by an exemption

activities;
the relevant new legislation starts applying, from that time, to the 
relevant part of the regulated principal’s regulated activities, and 
subsection (1) continues to apply to the person as if the regulated 
principal’s regulated activities did not include the relevant part.

1432  Continued application of relevant old legislation
(1) Subject to subsection (2), during the transition period for a 
regulated principal, the relevant old legislation (if any) continues to 
apply, despite its repeal:
(a) to, and in relation to, the regulated principal and their 
regulated activities; and
(b) to any other person to whom it is expressed to apply, but only 
in relation to matters related to the regulated principal and 
their regulated activities.
Note: So, for example, people may continue to be appointed as agents or 
representatives of the regulated principal (or to have those 
appointments varied or revoked) during the transition period under 
provisions of the relevant old legislation that deal with such matters.

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025all or any of the relevant financial services (so far as ASIC is aware 
of such conduct and experience).
(3) Subsection (2) is not intended to limit, by implication, the matters 
that ASIC can take into account under section 913B of the 
amended Corporations Act when considering whether to grant a 
licence under that section (whether pursuant to an application to 
which this section applies or otherwise).
1436  Treatment of representatives—general
(1) This section applies to a person who is a representative of a 
regulated principal. For this purpose, a representative includes, but 
is not limited to:
(a) an agent (however described) of the regulated principal; and
(b) an employee or director of the regulated principal; and
(c) any other person who, in accordance with the regulated 
principal’s relevant old legislation as it continues to have 
effect in relation to the regulated principal, is authorised to 
carry on activities for or on behalf of the regulated principal.
(1A) However, if a person who, under subsection (1), would be the 
representative of another person is a financial services licensee in 
their own right, the licensee, when engaged in activities covered by 
their licence, is taken not to be acting as representative of that other 
person.
(2) The following provisions apply in relation to a person who is a 
representative of a regulated principal:
(a) during any period when, because of section 1431, the 
relevant new legislation (within the meaning of 
subsection 1431(1)) does not apply to the regulated principal 
and particular regulated activities, the relevant new 
legislation also does not apply to the representative when 
they are acting as a representative of the regulated principal 
in relation to any of those activities;
(b) during any period when, because of section 1432, relevant 
old legislation continues to apply to the regulated principal

continues to apply to the representative when they are acting 
as a representative of the regulated principal in relation to 
any of those activities.
Note 1: If a person is a representative of 2 persons, this may result in the 
person having to comply with the relevant new legislation in respect 
of what they do as a representative of one of those persons but, at the 
same time, having to comply with relevant old legislation in respect of 
what they do as a representative of the other of those persons.
Note 2: If a person is a representative of another person who carries on 2 
different sets of activities, being sets of activities in relation to which 
there are separate applications of this Subdivision because of 
subsection 1430(3), this may result in the person having to comply 
with the relevant new legislation in respect of what they do in relation 
to one of those sets of activities but, at the same time, having to 
comply with relevant old legislation in respect of what they do in 
relation to the other set of activities.
Note 3: Because of section 1441, a representative who is not required to 
comply with the relevant new legislation may nonetheless be required 
to comply with obligations under Part 7.9 of the amended 
Corporations Act.
1436A  Treatment of representatives—insurance agents

including sections 1436 and 1437.

commencement, a person is an insurance intermediary (but not an 
insurance broker) within the meaning of the Insurance (Agents and 
Brokers) Act 1984 as then in force because of an agreement they 
have with an insurer under section 10 of that Act. For the purposes 
of this section:
(a) the person is the insurance agent; and
(b) the agreement is the authorising agreement; and
(c) the matters dealt with in the provisions included in the 
agreement in compliance with section 10 of that Act, and any 
other matters included in the agreement that are related to 
those matters, are the relevant matters; and

(including as it has effect because of section 1434) of the 
amended Corporations Act that covers the insurance agent 
engaging in (as licensee) the range of activities that they 
previously engaged in as agent under the authorising 
agreement.

paragraph (3)(c) may before the date, or the end of the period, 
specified in the original notice as mentioned in that paragraph:
(a) be varied to specify another date or period, being a date or 
period that would satisfy the requirements of

Subdivision A—Introduction
1578  Simplified outline of this Division
This Division deals with the way this Act will apply to external 
administrations when the provisions of the Insolvency Practice 
Schedule (Corporations) begin to operate.
New external administrations
The Insolvency Practice Schedule (Corporations) applies to 
external administrations that start on or after the commencement of 
the Insolvency Law Reform Act 2016 (called new external 
administrations).
Ongoing external administrations
For external administrations that start before that day but are still 
ongoing (called ongoing external administrations), the Insolvency 
Practice Schedule (Corporations) applies in accordance with this 
Division but usually only in relation to new events. Generally, the 
old Act continues to apply to old events and processes that are 
incomplete. There are some exceptions.
Old external administrations
For old external administrations that have ended but that may have 
ongoing obligations or processes, in most cases the old Act 
continues to apply.
