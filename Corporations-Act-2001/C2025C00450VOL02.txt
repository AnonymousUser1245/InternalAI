Stay on enforcing rights

publicly announced that it will be making an application 
under section 411 for the purpose of avoiding being wound 
up in insolvency; or
(b) the reason that the body is the subject of an application under

arrangement approved under this Part as a result of an 
application under section 411; or

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(ii) the body’s financial position;
if such an announcement, application, compromise or 
arrangement is later made about the body; or
(f) a reason that, in substance, is contrary to this subsection;
if the right arises for that reason by express provision (however 
described) of a contract, agreement or arrangement.
Note: This result is subject to subsections (5), (6) and (8), and to any order 
under section 415E.
Example: A right to terminate a contract will not be enforceable to the extent 
that those rights are triggered by the body becoming the subject of 
such an announcement, application, compromise or arrangement.
Period of the stay
(2) The right cannot be enforced as described in subsection (1) during 
the period (the stay period) that:
(a) starts:
(i) if the body makes an announcement referred to in 
paragraph (1)(a)—when the announcement is made; or
(ii) otherwise—when the application under section 411 is 
made; and
(b) ends:
(i) if the body makes an announcement referred to in 
paragraph (1)(a), and fails to make the announced 
application within the next 3 months or within any 
period ordered under subsection (3) for the body—at the 
end of the longer of those periods; or
(ii) when the application under section 411 is withdrawn or 
when the Court dismisses the application; or

compromise or arrangement approved under this Part as

satisfied that the longer period is appropriate having regard to the 
interests of justice.
Enforcing rights after the stay for reasons relating to earlier 
circumstances
(4) The right is unenforceable against the body indefinitely after the 
end of the stay period to the extent that a reason for seeking to 
enforce the right:
(a) is the body’s financial position before the end of the stay 
period; or
(b) is the body having been the subject of any of the following 
before the end of the stay period:
(i) an announcement referred to in paragraph (1)(a);
(ii) an application under section 411;
(iii) a compromise or arrangement approved under this Part 
as a result of an application under section 411; or

this paragraph, relating to circumstances in existence during 
the stay period; or
(d) is a reason referred to in paragraph (1)(e) or (f).
Application must be made to avoid insolvency
(5) However, subsection (1) does not apply, and is taken never to have 
applied, if the application under section 411 fails to state that it is 
being made for the purpose of the body avoiding being wound up 
in insolvency.
Rights not subject to the stay
(6) Subsection (1) does not apply to the right if it is:
(a) a right under a contract, agreement or arrangement entered

a compromise or arrangement as a result of the application 
takes effect; or

419A  Liability of controller under pre-existing agreement about 
property used by corporation
(1) This section applies if:
(a) under an agreement made before the control day in relation to 
a controller of property of a corporation, the corporation 
continues after that day to use or occupy, or to be in 
possession of, property (the third party property) of which 
someone else is the owner or lessor; and
(b) the controller is controller of the third party property.
(2) Subject to subsections (4) and (7), the controller is liable for so 
much of the rent or other amounts payable by the corporation 
under the agreement as is attributable to a period:
(a) that begins more than 7 days after the control day; and
(b) throughout which:
(i) the corporation continues to use or occupy, or to be in 
possession of, the third party property; and
(ii) the controller is controller of the third party property.

Section 419A
Corporations Act 2001 301
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(3) Within 7 days after the control day, the controller may give to the 
owner or lessor a notice that specifies the third party property and 
states that the controller does not propose to exercise rights in 
relation to that property as controller of the property, whether on 
behalf of the corporation or anyone else.
(4) Despite subsection (2), the controller is not liable for so much of 
the rent or other amounts payable by the corporation under the 
agreement as is attributable to a period during which a notice under 
subsection (3) is in force, but such a notice does not affect a 
liability of the corporation.
(5) A notice under subsection (3) ceases to have effect if:
(a) the controller revokes it by writing given to the owner or 
lessor; or
(b) the controller exercises, or purports to exercise, a right in 
relation to the third party property as controller of the 
property, whether on behalf of the corporation or anyone 
else.
(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the controller does not exercise, 
or purport to exercise, a right as mentioned in paragraph (5)(b) 
merely because the controller continues to be in possession, or to 
have control, of the third party property, unless the controller:
(a) also uses the property; or
(b) asserts a right, as against the owner or lessor, so to continue.
(7) Subsection (2) does not apply in so far as a court, by order, excuses 
the controller from liability, but an order does not affect a liability 
of the corporation.
(8) The controller is not taken because of subsection (2):
(a) to have adopted the agreement; or
(b) to be liable under the agreement otherwise than as mentioned 
in subsection (2).

the attainment of the objectives for which the receiver was 
appointed.
(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), but subject to any 
provision of the court order by which, or the instrument under 
which, the receiver was appointed, being a provision that limits the 
receiver’s powers in any way, a receiver of property of a

up and, in connection therewith, to receive dividends and to

(3) The conferring by this section on a receiver of powers in relation to 
property of a corporation does not affect any rights in relation to 
that property of any other person other than the corporation.
(4) In this section, a reference, in relation to a receiver, to property of a 
corporation is, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to 
the property of the corporation in relation to which the receiver 
was appointed.

420A  Controller’s duty of care in exercising power of sale
(1) In exercising a power of sale in respect of property of a 
corporation, a controller must take all reasonable care to sell the 
property for:
(a) if, when it is sold, it has a market value—not less than that 
market value; or
(b) otherwise—the best price that is reasonably obtainable, 
having regard to the circumstances existing when the 
property is sold.
(2) Nothing in subsection (1) limits the generality of anything in 
section 180, 181, 182, 183 or 184.
420B  Court may authorise managing controller to dispose of 
property despite prior security interest
(1) On the application of a managing controller of property of a 
corporation, the Court may by order authorise the controller to sell, 
or to dispose of in some other specified way, specified property of 
the corporation, even though it is subject to a security interest (the 
prior security interest) that has priority over a security interest (the 
controller’s security interest) in that property that the controller is 
enforcing.
(2) However, the Court may only make an order if satisfied that:
(a) apart from the existence of the prior security interest, the 
controller would have power to sell, or to so dispose of, the 
property; and
(b) the controller has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the 
consent of the secured party in relation to the prior security 
interest to the sale or disposal, but has not obtained that 
consent; and

interests of the corporation’s creditors and of the corporation; 
and
(d) sale or disposal of the property under the order will not 
unreasonably prejudice the rights or interests of the secured 
party in relation to the prior security interest.
(3) The Court is to have regard to the need to protect adequately the 
rights and interests of the secured party in relation to the prior 
security interest.
(4) If the property would be sold or disposed of together with other 
property that is subject to the controller’s security interest, the 
Court may have regard to:
(a) the amount (if any) by which it is reasonable to expect that 
the net proceeds of selling or disposing of that other property 
otherwise than together with the first-mentioned property 
would be less than so much of the net proceeds of selling or 
disposing of all the property together as would be attributable 
to that other property; and
(b) the amount (if any) by which it is reasonable to expect that 
the net proceeds of selling or disposing of the first-mentioned 
property otherwise than together with the other property 
would be greater than so much of the net proceeds of selling 
or disposing of all the property together as would be 
attributable to the first-mentioned property.
(5) Nothing in subsection (3) or (4) limits the matters to which the 
Court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (2).
(6) An order may be made subject to conditions, for example (but 
without limitation):
(a) a condition that:
(i) the net proceeds of the sale or disposal; and
(ii) the net proceeds of the sale or disposal of such other 
property (if any) as is specified in the condition and is 
subject to the controller’s security interest;

approval; and
(b) do whatever is necessarily incidental to carrying on that

(a) a reference that a right cannot be enforced (however described) 
as including a reference that a self-executing provision cannot 
start to apply; and
(b) the words “if the right arises for that reason by express provision 
(however described) of a contract, agreement or arrangement” as 
being omitted from subsection 434J(1); and
(c) a reference that one or more rights are enforceable as including a

Scope
(1) This section applies if a security interest in property (the secured 
property) of a company under administration was a circulating 
security interest when the interest arose, but has stopped being a 
circulating security interest because:
(a) in the case of a PPSA security interest—the property has 
stopped being a circulating asset (within the meaning of the 
Personal Property Securities Act 2009); or
(b) in the case of a security interest that was a floating charge 
when it arose—the floating charge has since become a fixed 
or specific charge.
Note 1: A circulating security interest can be either a PPSA security interest to 
which a circulating asset has attached or a floating charge: see the 
definition of circulating security interest in section 9.

Property Securities Act 2009.

interest, the administrator may deal with any of the secured 
property in any way the company could deal with the secured 
property immediately before it stopped being a circulating asset.
Floating charge
(3) Subject to sections 442C and 442D, in the case of a security 
interest that was a floating charge when it arose, the administrator 
may deal with any of the secured property as if the security interest 
were still a floating charge.
Note: Section 442C deals with the disposal of encumbered property by an 
administrator. Section 442D makes the administrator’s functions and 
powers subject to those of a secured party, receiver or controller.
442C  When administrator may dispose of encumbered property
(1) The administrator of a company under administration or of a deed 
of company arrangement must not dispose of:
(a) property of the company that is subject to a security interest; 
or
(b) property (other than PPSA retention of title property) that is 
used or occupied by, or is in the possession of, the company 
but of which someone else is the owner or lessor.
Note: PPSA retention of title property is subject to a PPSA security interest, 
and so is covered by paragraph (a) (see definition of PPSA retention 
of title property in section 51F).
(2) Subsection (1) does not prevent a disposal:
(a) in the ordinary course of the company’s business; or
(b) with the written consent of the secured party, owner or lessor, 
as the case may be; or
(c) with the leave of the Court.

not to carry out that proposal.
(5) The Court may only make an order under subsection (4) on the

(7) If:
(a) a company is under administration or is subject to a deed of

(b) property of the company is subject to a security interest; and
(c) the administrator disposes of the property;
the disposal extinguishes the security interest.

a disposal of the property that occurs after the demand is made 
does not mean that the disposal is not in the ordinary course of the

451GA  Self-executing provisions
(1) The object of subsection (2) is to ensure that a self-executing

(b) can be the subject of a Court order providing that the 
provision can only start to apply against a company with the

to a right. For this purpose, assume those sections apply with such 
modifications as are necessary, including any prescribed by the 
regulations for the purposes of this subsection.
Note 1: This subsection achieves the object in subsection (1) by extending the 
application of all of the outcomes, exceptions and powers in

(a) a reference that a right cannot be enforced (however described) 
as including a reference that a self-executing provision cannot 
start to apply; and
(b) the words “if the right arises for that reason by express provision 
(however described) of a contract, agreement or arrangement” as 
being omitted from subsection 451E(1); and
(c) a reference that one or more rights are enforceable as including a 
reference that one or more self-executing provisions can start to 
apply; and
(d) paragraph 451G(2)(b) as alternatively providing that the Court is 
satisfied that one or more reasons referred to in paragraphs 
451E(1)(a) to (d) can cause the self-executing provisions to start 
to apply.

of a right, or the performance or exercise of a function or power, if 
the enforcement, performance or exercise is authorised by (or 
because of) a transaction or dealing that gives rise to a security 
interest in the property concerned.
Example: An example of a transaction or dealing in relation to which 
sections 454K to 454M do not apply because of this section is a 
commercial consignment of personal property. Such a transaction 
gives rise to a PPSA security interest because of section 12 of the 
Personal Property Securities Act 2009. The consigned property is 
PPSA retention of title property of the company (see sections 51F and 
452B).
Note: Sections 454C to 454H (property subject to security interests) may 
apply in relation to transactions or dealings to which this Subdivision 
does not apply because of this section. For example, sections 454C to 
454H would apply in relation to a commercial consignment of 
personal property, because such a transaction gives rise to a PPSA 
security interest.

Section 454R
464 Corporations Act 2001
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(3) An order under subsection (1) must specify the period for which it 
applies. In working out the period, the Court must have regard to:
(a) subsections 454N(2), (3) and (4); and
(b) the interests of justice.
(4) Subsection (1) does not apply to a right referred to in 
subsection 454N(5) or (7).
Note: An order under subsection (1) also does not restrict certain secured 
creditors (see sections 454C to 454H).
Interim orders
(5) Before deciding an application for an order under subsection (1), 
the Court may grant an interim order for one or more rights under a 
contract, agreement or arrangement not to be enforced against a 
company.
(6) The Court must not require an applicant for an order under 
subsection (1) to give an undertaking as to damages as a condition 
of granting an interim order.
454R  Self-executing provisions
(1) The object of subsection (2) is to ensure that a self-executing 
provision:
(a) cannot start to apply against a company for certain reasons; 
and
(b) can be the subject of a Court order providing that the 
provision can only start to apply against a company with the 
leave of the Court, and in accordance with such terms (if any) 
as the Court imposes.
(2) Sections 454N to 454Q also apply in relation to a self-executing 
provision in a corresponding way to the way they apply in relation 
to a right. For this purpose, assume those sections apply with such 
modifications as are necessary, including any prescribed by the 
regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

(b) the words “if the right arises for that reason by express provision 
(however described) of a contract, agreement or arrangement” as

(c) a reference that one or more rights are enforceable as including a 
reference that one or more self-executing provisions can start to 
apply; and
(d) paragraph 454Q(2)(b) as alternatively providing that the Court is 
satisfied that one or more reasons referred to in paragraphs 
454N(1)(a) to (d) can cause the self-executing provisions to start 
to apply.
(3) In this section:
self-executing provision means a provision of a contract, 
agreement or arrangement that can start to apply automatically:
(a) for one or more reasons; and
(b) without any party to the contract, agreement or arrangement 
making a decision that the provision should start to apply.

company to be wound up on the application; or
(b) adjourn the hearing conditionally or unconditionally; or
(c) make any interim or other order that it thinks fit.
(2) The Court must not refuse to make a winding up order merely

568D  Effect of disclaimer
(1) A disclaimer is taken to have terminated, as from the day on which 
it is taken because of subsection 568C(3) to take effect, the 
company’s rights, interests, liabilities and property in or in respect 
of the disclaimer property, but does not affect any other person’s 
rights or liabilities except so far as necessary in order to release the 
company and its property from liability.
(2) A person aggrieved by the operation of a disclaimer is taken to be a 
creditor of the company to the extent of any loss suffered by the 
person because of the disclaimer and may prove such a loss as a 
debt in the winding up.
568E  Application to set aside disclaimer after it has taken effect
(1) With the leave of the Court, a person who has, or claims to have, 
an interest in disclaimed property may apply to the Court for an 
order setting aside the disclaimer after it has taken effect.

unreasonable in all the circumstances to expect the person to have 
applied for an order setting aside the disclaimer before it took 
effect.
(3) The Court may give leave subject to conditions.
(4) On an application under subsection (1), the Court:
(a) may by order set aside the disclaimer; and

(5) However, the Court may set aside a disclaimer only if satisfied that 
the disclaimer has caused, or would cause, to persons who have, or 
claim to have, interests in the property, prejudice that is grossly out 
of proportion to the prejudice that setting aside the disclaimer (and 
making any further orders) would cause to:
(a) the company’s creditors; and
(b) persons who have changed their position in reliance on the

(1) The Court may order that disclaimed property vest in, or be 
delivered to:
(a) a person entitled to the property; or
(b) a person in or to whom it seems to the Court appropriate that 
the property be vested or delivered; or
(c) a person as trustee for a person of a kind referred to in 
paragraph (a) or (b).
(2) The Court may make an order under subsection (1):
(a) on the application of a person who claims an interest in the 
property, or is under a liability in respect of the property that 
this Act has not discharged; and
(b) after hearing such persons as it thinks appropriate.
(3) Subject to subsection (4), where an order is made under 
subsection (1) vesting property, the property vests immediately, for 
the purposes of the order, without any conveyance, transfer or 
assignment.
(4) Where:
(a) a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory 
requires the transfer of property vested by an order under 
subsection (1) to be registered; and

Making of employee entitlements contribution order
(1) The Court may make an order under subsection (2) (an employee 
entitlements contribution order) in relation to an entity (the 
contributing entity) if the Court is satisfied that:
(a) a company (the insolvent company) is being wound up; and
(b) an amount (the unpaid entitlements amount) of the 
entitlements of one or more employees (within the meaning 
of Part 5.8A) of the insolvent company that are protected 
under Part 5.8A has not been paid; and
(c) the contributing entity is a member of the same contribution 
order group (see subsection (6)) as the insolvent company; 
and
(d) the contributing entity has benefited, directly or indirectly, 
from work done by those employees; and
(e) that benefit exceeds the benefit that would be reasonable in 
the circumstances if the insolvent company and the 
contributing entity were dealing at arm’s length; and
(f) it is just and equitable to make the order.
Note 1: For the people who may apply to the Court for an employee 
entitlements contribution order, see section 588ZB.
Note 2: A reference in Part 5.8A to an employee of a company is a reference 
to a current or former employee, and includes a reference to another 
person to whom an entitlement of an employee is owed (see 
section 596AA).
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the Court may order the 
contributing entity to pay to the liquidator of the insolvent 
company an amount that:
(a) reflects the value of the excess referred to in 
paragraph (1)(e); and

order, exceed the unpaid entitlements amount.
(3) The payment of an amount in accordance with an employee 
entitlements contribution order is not to be taken to be an advance 
of money for the purposes of section 560.
(4) In determining whether it is just and equitable to make an 
employee entitlements contribution order, the Court may have 
regard to the following matters:
(a) the size of the excess referred to in paragraph (1)(e);
(b) the nature of the relationship between the contributing entity 
and the insolvent company;
(c) any efforts made by the contributing entity, or officers of the 
contributing entity, and officers of the insolvent company to 
pay or to provide for the payment of the unpaid entitlements 
amount;
(d) if the contributing entity is solvent—whether the order is 
likely to result in the contributing entity becoming insolvent;
(e) the extent (if any) to which the order is likely to result in the 
contributing entity becoming unable to pay the entitlements 
of its employees or make distributions to creditors;
(f) any other matters that the Court considers appropriate.
(5) If the Court makes an employee entitlements contribution order, 
the Court may do the following:
(a) if the contributing entity is a company—order that the 
obligation to pay an amount under the order has the priority 
of a debt or claim covered by any of paragraph 556(1)(e), (f), 
(g) or (h) in the winding up of the contributing entity 
(whether or not the contributing entity is being wound up 
when the order is made);
(b) make any other orders, and give any directions, that the Court 
considers appropriate for the purposes of giving effect to the 
employee entitlements contribution order.

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Part 5.8A—Employee entitlements
  
596AA  Objects and coverage of this Part
Objects
(1) The objects of this Part are to:
(a) deter avoidance of the payment of the entitlements of 
employees; and
(b) protect the entitlements of a company’s employees from 
agreements, arrangements and transactions that avoid or 
prevent the recovery of those entitlements, or significantly 
reduce the amount of those entitlements that can be 
recovered, in the winding up of the company.
Employee entitlements
(2) The entitlements of an employee of a company that are protected 
under this Part are:
(a) wages payable by the company for services rendered to the 
company by the employee; and
(b) superannuation contributions (that is, contributions by the 
company to a fund or scheme for the purposes of making 
provision for, or obtaining, superannuation benefits 
(including defined benefits) for the employee, or for 
dependants of the employee) payable by the company in 
respect of services rendered to the company by the employee; 
and
(c) amounts due in respect of injury compensation in relation to 
the employee; and
(d) amounts due under an industrial instrument in respect of the 
employee’s leave of absence; and
(e) retrenchment payments for the employee (that is, amounts

Section 596AB
Corporations Act 2001 757
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025instrument, in respect of the termination of the employee’s 
employment by the company).
(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2), an entitlement of an employee 
need not be owed to the employee. It might, for example, be:
(a) an amount owed to the employee’s dependants; or
(b) a superannuation contribution payable to a fund in respect of 
services rendered by the employee; or
(c) a right in relation to an entitlement that becomes a right of 
the Commonwealth under paragraph 31(1)(b) of the Fair 
Entitlements Guarantee Act 2012; or
(d) an entitlement in relation to which an entity other than the 
employee has a right of subrogation.
(3) The entitlements of an excluded employee (within the meaning of 
section 556) are protected under this Part only to the extent to 
which they have priority under paragraph 556(1)(e), (f), (g) or (h).
Employees
(4) For the purposes of this Part, a person is an employee of a company 
if the person is, or has been, an employee of the company (whether 
remunerated by salary, wages, commission or otherwise).
(5) If an entitlement of an employee of a company is owed to a person 
other than the employee, this Part applies to the entitlement as if a 
reference to the employee included a reference to the person to 
whom the entitlement is owed.
