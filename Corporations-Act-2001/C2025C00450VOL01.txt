(c) the legislative powers that the Commonwealth Parliament 
has under section 122 of the Constitution to make laws for 
the government of the external Territories.
(4) The operation of this Act in a State that is not a referring State is

normal course of communication, storage or display.
Note: This subsection allows minor differences that arise from the way a 
document is signed to be disregarded. For example, a person can sign 
to witness the fixing of a common seal to a document, and it is not 
necessary for the signed document to include the common seal (as 
long as a method is used to indicate that the person observed the 
fixing of the seal, as required by paragraph 127(2A)(c)).

(4) To avoid doubt, this section does not require:
(a) a person to sign the same form of the document as another 
person; or
(b) a person to sign the same page of the document as another 
person; or
(c) a person to use the same method to sign the document as 
another person; or
(d) all the information recorded in the document to be included 
in the form of the document signed by a person as mentioned 
in paragraph (1)(a) or (b).
Note: For example, a company may execute a document by one director 
signing a physical form of the document by hand, and another director 
signing an electronic form of the document by electronic means.
Persons signing in different capacities
(5) For the purposes of this section, a person who is to sign a 
document in more than one capacity:
(a) is treated as a different person in each such capacity they sign 
the document; and
(b) may sign the document in some or all of those capacities by 
signing the document once, if the document:
(i) requires or permits the person to do so; and
(ii) states the capacities in which the person is signing the 
document.
Example 1: If a signature block in a document requires or permits a person to sign 
once as the sole director and sole company secretary of a company, 
the person may sign the document as the sole director and sole 
company secretary by signing that signature block.
Example 2: If a signature block in a document requires or permits a person to sign 
once on behalf of 2 companies as an agent for both those companies, 
the person may sign the document as an agent for both those 
companies by signing that signature block.
Example 3: A person who is to sign a document in their capacity as the director of 
one company and their capacity as the company secretary of another 
company must sign the document twice if:

If:
(a) under this Act, the signature of a person is required or 
permitted on a document; and
(b) the person signs the document in accordance with 
section 110A; and
(c) the person or another person submits the document for

lodgement under this Act or an instrument made under this 
Act;
ASIC or the Registrar (as the case requires) must not refuse to 
receive or register the document on the basis that the document has 
not been signed.
Note: This section does not prevent ASIC or the Registrar from refusing to 
receive or register the document on any other basis. For example, if 
the lodgement requirements mentioned in paragraph (d) (such as those 
under Chapter 2P) are not met, ASIC or the Registrar may refuse to 
receive or register the document.

1  What registration means
1.1 Separate legal entity that has its own powers
As far as the law is concerned, a company has a separate legal 
existence that is distinct from that of its owners, managers, 
operators, employees and agents. A company has its own property, 
its own rights and its own obligations. A company’s money and 
other assets belong to the company and must be used for the 
company’s purposes.
A company has the powers of an individual, including the powers 
to:
• own and dispose of property and other assets
• enter into contracts
• sue and be sued.

Section 1
Corporations Act 2001 243
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Once a company is registered, its separate legal status, property, 
rights and liabilities continue until ASIC (Australian Securities and 
Investments Commission) deregisters the company.
[sections 119, 124—125, 601AA—601AD]
1.2 Limited liability of shareholders
Shareholders of a company are not liable (in their capacity as 
shareholders) for the company’s debts. As shareholders, their only 
obligation is to pay the company any amount unpaid on their 
shares if they are called upon to do so. However, particularly if a 
shareholder is also a director, this limitation may be affected by 
other laws and the commercial practices discussed in 1.3 and 1.4.
[section 516]
1.3 Director’s liability for company’s debts
A director of a company may be liable for debts incurred by the 
company at a time when the company itself is unable to pay those 
debts as they fall due.
A director of a company may be liable to compensate the company 
for any losses the company suffers from a breach of certain of the 
director’s duties to the company (see 5.3).
In addition to having liability for the company’s debts or to pay 
compensation to the company, a director may also be subject to a 
civil penalty.
If a company holds property on trust, a director of the company 
may be liable in some circumstances for liabilities incurred by the 
company as trustee.
[sections 197, 344, 588G, 588J, 588M, 1317H]
1.4 Director’s liability as guarantor/security over personal assets
As a matter of commercial practice, a bank, trade creditor or 
anyone else providing finance or credit to a company may ask a 
director of the company:

Part 1.5  Small business guide
  
Section 1
244 Corporations Act 2001
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025• for a personal guarantee of the company’s liabilities; and
• for some form of security over their house or personal 
assets to secure the performance by the company of its 
obligations.
The director of a company may, for example, be asked by a bank to 
give a mortgage over their house to secure the company’s 
repayment of a loan. If the company does not repay the loan as 
agreed with the bank, the director may lose the house.
1.5 Continuous existence
A company continues to exist even if 1 or more of its shareholders 
or directors sells their shares, dies or leaves the company. If a 
company has only 1 shareholder who is also the only director of 
the company and that person dies, their personal representative is 
able to ensure that the company continues to operate.
[sections 119, 224A]
1.6 Rules for the internal management of a company
The Corporations Act contains a basic set of rules for the internal 
management of a company (appointments, meetings etc.).
Some of these rules are mandatory for all companies. There are a 
few special rules for single shareholder/single director companies.
Other internal management rules in the Corporations Act are 
replaceable rules. The replaceable rules do not apply to:
• a single shareholder/single director company; or
• a company that had a constitution before the introduction 
of the replaceable rules regime and has not repealed it.
A company does not need to have a separate constitution of its 
own; it can simply take advantage of the rules in the Corporations 
Act. The company will need a constitution only if it wants to 
displace, modify or add to the replaceable rules.

Corporations Act 2001 245
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025[sections 134-141 and 198E]
1.7 How a company acts
A company does not have a physical existence. It must act through 
other people.
Individual directors, the company secretary, company employees 
or agents may be authorised to enter into contracts that bind the 
company (see 7).
In some circumstances, a company will be bound by something 
done by another person (see 1.8).
1.8 Directors
The directors of a company are responsible for managing the 
company’s business. It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that generally 
the directors may exercise all the powers of the company except a 
power that the Corporations Act, a replaceable rule or a provision 
of the company’s constitution (if any) requires the company to 
exercise in general meeting.
The only director of a company who is also the only shareholder is 
responsible for managing the company’s business and may 
exercise all of the company’s powers.
The Corporations Act sets out rules dealing with the calling and 
conduct of directors’ meetings. Directors must keep a written 
record (minutes) of their resolutions and meetings.
There are 2 ways that directors may pass resolutions:
• at a meeting; or
• by having all of the directors record and sign their 
decision.
If a company has only 1 director, the sole director may also pass a 
resolution by recording and signing their decision.

1.9 Shareholders
The shareholders of a company own the company, but the 
company has a separate legal existence and the company’s assets 
belong to the company.
Shareholders can make decisions about the company by passing a 
resolution, usually at a meeting. A “special resolution” usually 
involves more important questions affecting the company as a 
whole or the rights of some or all of its shareholders.
There are 2 ways that shareholders may pass a resolution:
• at a meeting; or
• by having all of the shareholders record and sign their 
decision.
If a meeting is held, an ordinary resolution must be passed by a 
majority of the votes cast by shareholders of the company entitled 
to vote on the resolution at the meeting in person or by proxy (if 
proxies are allowed). A special resolution must be passed by at 
least 75% of the votes cast by shareholders of the company entitled 
to vote on the resolution and who vote at the meeting in person or 
by proxy (if proxies are allowed).
The sole shareholder of a company may pass a resolution by 
recording and signing their decision.
A company must keep a written record (minutes) of the members’ 
resolutions and meetings.
[sections 9 (special resolution), 249A, 249B, 249L, 251A]
1.10 What others can assume about the company
Anyone who does any business with the company is entitled to 
assume that the company has a legal right to conduct that business

Section 2
Corporations Act 2001 247
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025unless the person knows, or suspects, otherwise. For example, an 
outsider dealing with the company is entitled to assume:
• that a person who is shown in a notice lodged with ASIC 
as being the director or company secretary of a company 
has been properly appointed and is authorised to act for the 
company; and
• that a person who is held out by the company to be a 
director, company secretary or agent of the company has 
been properly appointed and is authorised to act for the 
company.
[sections 128—130]
2  The company structure for small business
2.1 Proprietary company for small business
Generally, a proprietary company limited by shares is the most 
suitable company for use by small business. Such a proprietary 
company must have a least 1 shareholder but no more than 50 
shareholders (not counting employee shareholders, CSF 
shareholders, or holders of shares issued pursuant to CSF offers 
that have yet to be traded in certain ways). It may have 1 or more 
directors.
[sections 112—113]
3  Setting up a new company
The operators of small businesses can either buy “shelf” companies 
or set up new companies themselves.
3.1 “Shelf” companies
The operator of a small business may find it more convenient to 
buy a “shelf” company (a company that has already been registered 
but has not traded) from businesses which set up companies for 
this purpose or from some legal or accounting firms.

Part 1.5  Small business guide
  
Section 3
248 Corporations Act 2001
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/20253.2 Setting up a company
To set up a new company themselves, the operator must apply to 
ASIC for registration of the company.
A proprietary company limited by shares must have at least 1 
shareholder.
To obtain registration, a person must lodge a properly completed 
application form with ASIC. The form must set out certain 
information including details of every person who has consented to 
be a shareholder, director or company secretary of the company.
The company comes into existence when ASIC registers it.
[sections 117—119, 135—136, 140]
3.3 ACN and name
When a company is registered, ASIC allocates to it a unique 9 digit 
number called the Australian Company Number (ACN). (For use 
of the ACN see 4.1).
In practice, a new company must have a name that is different from 
the name of a company that is already registered. A proprietary 
company limited by shares must have the words “Proprietary 
Limited” as part of its name. Those words can be abbreviated to 
“Pty Ltd”.
A proprietary company may adopt its ACN as its name. If it does 
so, its name must also contain the words “Australian Company 
Number” (which can be abbreviated to “ACN”). For example, the 
company’s name might be “ACN 123 456 789 Pty Ltd”.
[sections 119, 147—161]
3.4 Contracts entered into before the company is registered
A company can ratify a contract entered into by someone on its 
behalf or for its benefit before it was registered. If the company 
does not ratify the contract, the person who entered into the 
contract may be personally liable.

3.5 First shareholders, directors and company secretary
A person listed with their consent as a shareholder, director or 
company secretary in the application for registration of the 
company becomes a shareholder, director or company secretary of 
the company on its registration.
The same person may be both a director of the company and the 
company secretary.
See 5.1 and 5.2 for directors and 5.4 for company secretaries. See 
6.1 for shareholders.
[section 120]
3.6 Issuing shares
It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that, before issuing new shares, a 
company must first offer them to the existing shareholders in the 
proportions that the shareholders already hold. A company may 
issue shares at a price it determines.
[sections 254B, 254D]
3.7 Registered office
A company must have a registered office in Australia and must 
inform ASIC of the location of the office. A post office box cannot 
be the registered office of a company. The purpose of the 
registered office is to have a place where all communications and 
notices to the company may be sent.
If the company does not occupy the premises where its registered 
office is located, the occupier of the premises must agree in writing 
to having the company’s registered office located there.
A proprietary company is not required to open its registered office 
to the public but this does not affect its obligation to make 
documents available for inspection.

3.8 Principal place of business
If a company has a principal place of business that is different from 
its registered office, it must notify ASIC of the address of its 
principal place of business and of any changes to that address.
[sections 117, 146]
3.9 Registers kept by the company
A company must keep registers, including a register of 
shareholders. A company must keep its registers at:
• the company’s registered office; or
• the company’s principal place of business; or
• a place (whether on premises of the company or of 
someone else) where the work in maintaining the register 
is done; or
• another place approved by ASIC.
A register may be kept either in a bound or looseleaf book or on 
computer.
If a register is kept on computer, its contents must be capable of 
being printed out in hard copy.
[sections 172, 1300, 1301, 1306]
3.10 Register of shareholders
A company must keep in its register of shareholders such 
information as:
• the names and addresses of its shareholders; and

4  Continuing obligations after the company is set up
The Corporations Act and other laws impose obligations on 
companies themselves and on their directors and company 
secretaries. Some of the more important obligations imposed under 
the Corporations Act are discussed below.
4.1 Use of company name and ACN
The name of a company must be shown at all the company’s 
business premises (including its registered office) that are open to 
the public. The company’s name and its ACN or ABN (if the last 9 
digits are the same, and in the same order, as the last 9 digits of its 
ACN) must appear:
• on some of its public documents; and
• on its cheques and negotiable instruments; and
• on all documents lodged with ASIC; and
• if it has one, on its common seal.
[sections 123, 144, 147—156,
ASIC Practice Note 47]
4.2 Extract of particulars
Each year, ASIC issues each company with an extract of 
particulars within 2 weeks of the company’s review date (which is 
generally the anniversary of the company’s registration). The 
extract includes details recorded on ASIC’s database such as:
• names and addresses of each director and company 
secretary;
• issued shares and options granted;

received, the company must correct those details.
The correction may be lodged with ASIC on a printed form or, if 
an agreement is in place to lodge electronically, in accordance with 
the agreement.
[Sections 346A and 346C, 352]
4.3 Review fee
A company must pay a review fee to ASIC each year.
[Corporations (Review Fees) Act 2003]

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Australia. If a company has more than 1 director, at least 1 of the 
directors must ordinarily reside in Australia.
A director must consent in writing to holding the position of 
director. The company must keep the consent and must notify 
ASIC of the appointment.
In some circumstances, the Corporations Act imposes the duties 
and obligations of a director on a person who, although not 
formally appointed as a director of a company, nevertheless acts as 
a director or gives instructions to the formally appointed directors 
as to how they should act.
The Court or ASIC may prohibit a person from being a director or 
from otherwise being involved in the management of a company if, 
for example, the person has breached the Corporations Act.
A person needs the Court’s permission to be a director if the person 
has been convicted of certain offences or is, in some 
circumstances, unable to pay their debts as they fall due.
Generally, a director may resign by giving notice of the resignation 
to the company. A director who resigns may notify ASIC of the 
resignation. If the director does not do so, the company must notify 
ASIC of the director’s resignation.

company that the director has).
A director who fails to perform their duties:
• may be guilty of a criminal offence with a penalty of 
imprisonment for up to 15 years or a fine, or both (the fine 
is the greater of 4,500 penalty units and 3 times the amount 
of the benefit derived and detriment avoided because of the 
offence); and
• may contravene a civil penalty provision (and the Court 
may order the person to pay the Commonwealth an amount 
equal to the greater of 5,000 penalty units and 3 times the 
amount of the benefit derived and detriment avoided 
because of the contravention); and
• may be personally liable to compensate the company or 
others for any loss or damage they suffer; and

5.4 Company secretaries
A company other than a proprietary company must have a 
company secretary. However, a proprietary company may choose 
to have a company secretary. The directors appoint the company 
secretary. A company secretary must be at least 18 years old. If a 
company has only 1 company secretary, they must ordinarily reside 
in Australia. If a company has more than 1 company secretary, at 
least 1 of them must ordinarily reside in Australia.
A company secretary must consent in writing to holding the 
position of company secretary. The company must keep the 
consent and must notify ASIC of the appointment.
The same person may be both a director of a company and the 
company secretary.
Generally, a company secretary may resign by giving written 
notice of the resignation to the company. A company secretary 
who resigns may notify ASIC of the resignation. If the company 
secretary does not do so, the company must notify ASIC of the 
company secretary’s resignation.
The company secretary is an officer of the company and, in that 
capacity, may be subject to the requirements imposed by the 
Corporations Act on company officers. 
The company secretary has specific responsibilities under the 
Corporations Act, including responsibility for ensuring that the 
company:
• notifies ASIC about changes to the identities, names and 
addresses of the company’s directors and company 
secretaries; and

6  Shares and shareholders
A proprietary company limited by shares must have a share capital 
and at least 1 shareholder. ASIC may apply to a Court to have a 
company wound up if it does not have any shareholders.
[sections 461—462]
6.1 Becoming a shareholder and ceasing to be a shareholder
A person may become a shareholder of a company in several ways, 
including the following:
• the person being listed as a shareholder of the company in 
the application for registration of the company
• the company issuing shares to the person
• the person buying shares in the company from an existing 
shareholder and the company registering the transfer.
Some of the ways in which a person ceases to be a shareholder are:
• the person sells all of their shares in the company and the 
company registers the transfer of the shares

A company may have different classes of shares. The rights and 
restrictions attached to the shares in a class distinguish it from 
other classes of shares.
[sections 254A—254B]
6.3 Meetings of shareholders
Directors have the power to call meetings of all shareholders or 
meetings of only those shareholders who hold a particular class of 
shares.
Shareholders who hold at least 5% of the votes which may be cast 
at a general meeting of a company have the power to call and hold 
a meeting themselves or to require the directors to call and hold a 
meeting. Meetings may be held regularly or to resolve specific 
questions about the management or business of the company.
The Corporations Act sets out rules dealing with shareholders’ 
meetings.
A shareholder of a company may ask the company for a copy of 
the record of a meeting or of a decision of shareholders taken 
without a meeting.
[sections 249A—251B]
6.4 Voting rights
Different rights to vote at meetings of shareholders may attach to 
different classes of shares. It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that, 
subject to those different rights, each shareholder has 1 vote on a 
show of hands and, on a poll, 1 vote for each share held.

(see 1.6) that the directors have a discretion to refuse to register a 
transfer of shares.

7  Signing company documents
A company’s power to sign, discharge and otherwise deal with 
contracts, or execute documents, can be exercised by an individual 
acting with the company’s authority and on its behalf. A company 
can deal with contracts without using a common seal.
A company may execute a document by having it signed by:
• 2 directors of the company; or
• a director and the company secretary; or
• for a company with a sole director who is also the sole 
secretary—that director; or
• for a company with a sole director and no company 
secretary—that director.
If the document is to have effect as a deed, it should be expressed 
to be a deed.
[sections 126—127]
A company is not required to have a common seal. If it does, the 
seal must show the company’s name and its ACN or ABN (if the 
last 9 digits are the same, and in the same order, as the last 9 digits 
of its ACN). The seal is equivalent to the company’s signature and 
may be used on important company documents such as mortgages.

The shareholders may fund the company’s operations by lending 
money to the company or by taking up other shares in the 
company. Except if it is raising funds from its own employees or 
shareholders or under a CSF offer, a proprietary company must not 
engage in any fundraising activity that would require disclosure to 
investors under Chapter 6D (for example, advertising in a 
newspaper inviting people to invest in the company).
The company may also borrow money from banks and other 
financial organisations.
Anyone who has lent money, or provided credit, to the company 
may ask for a security interest in the company’s assets to secure the 
performance by the company of its obligations.
[sections 113, 124]
9  Returns to shareholders
Shareholders can take money out of the company in a number of 
ways, but only if the company complies with its constitution (if 
any), the Corporations Act and all other relevant laws. If a 
company pays out money in a way that results in the company 
being unable to pay its debts as they fall due, its directors may be 
liable:
• to pay compensation; and
• for criminal and civil penalties.

9.1 Dividends
Dividends are payments to shareholders. They can only be paid if:
• the company’s assets are sufficiently in excess of its 
liabilities immediately before the dividend is declared; and

9.4 Distribution of surplus assets on winding up
If a company is wound up and there are any assets left over after all 
the company’s debts have been paid, the surplus is distributed to 
shareholders in accordance with the rights attaching to their shares.
10  Annual financial reports and audit
10.1 The small/large distinction
The accounting requirements imposed on a proprietary company 
under the Corporations Act depend on whether the company is 
classified as small or large. A company’s classification can change 
from 1 financial year to another as its circumstances change.
A company is classified as small for a financial year if it satisfies at 
least 2 of the following tests:
• gross operating revenue of less than $10 million for the 
year
• gross assets of less than $5 million at the end of the year
• fewer than 50 employees at the end of the year.

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025A company that does not satisfy at least 2 of these tests is classified 
as large.
[section 45A]
As the great majority of proprietary companies are small under 
these tests, the discussion below deals mainly with the accounting 
requirements for small proprietary companies.
[sections 286—301]
10.2 Financial records
Under the Corporations Act, all proprietary companies must keep 
sufficient financial records to record and explain their transactions 
and financial position and to allow true and fair financial 
statements to be prepared and audited. Financial record here 
means some kind of systematic record of the company’s financial 
transactions—not merely a collection of receipts, invoices, bank 
statements and cheque butts. Financial records may be kept on 
computer.
[sections 286—289]
10.3 Preparing annual financial reports and directors’ reports
The Corporations Act requires a small proprietary company to 
prepare an annual financial report (an annual profit and loss 
statement, a balance sheet and a statement of cash flows) and a 
directors’ report (about the company’s operations, dividends paid 
or recommended, options issued etc.) if:
• the shareholders with at least 5% of the votes in the 
company direct it to do so; or
• ASIC directs it to do so; or
• it has one or more CSF shareholders at any time during the 
financial year.

Section 11
Corporations Act 2001 263
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Unless the shareholders’ direction specifies otherwise, the 
company must prepare the annual financial report in accordance 
with the applicable accounting standards.
Although the Corporations Act itself may not require a small 
proprietary company to prepare a financial report except in the 
circumstances mentioned, the company may need to prepare the 
annual financial reports for the purposes of other laws (for 
example, income tax laws). Moreover, good business practice may 
also make it advisable for the company to prepare the financial 
reports so that it can monitor and better manage its financial 
position.
Large proprietary companies must prepare annual financial reports 
and a directors’ report, have the financial report audited and send 
both reports to shareholders. They must also lodge the annual 
financial reports with ASIC unless exempted.

11  Disagreements within the company
11.1 Special problems faced by minority shareholders
There are remedies available to a shareholder of a company if:
• the affairs of the company are being conducted in a way 
that is unfair to that shareholder or to other shareholders of 
the company; or
• the affairs of the company are being conducted in a way 
that is against the interests of the company as a whole.
A Court may, for example, order the winding up of a company or 
the appointment of a receiver.

A company may buy back the shares of a shareholder who wants to 
sever their relationship with the company.
[sections 257A—257J]
11.3 Selling shares
A shareholder in a company who wants to sever their relationship 
with the company may decide to sell their shares. However, the 
shareholder may not be able to sell their shares readily—
particularly if they want to sell their shares to someone who is not 
an existing shareholder. Some of the difficulties they may face in 
that case are:
• under the replaceable rules the directors have a discretion 
to refuse to transfer the shares; and
• restrictions in the company’s constitution (if any) on 
transferring shares.

12  Companies in financial trouble
12.1 Voluntary administration
If a company experiences financial problems, the directors may 
appoint an administrator to take over the operations of the 
company to see if the company’s creditors and the company can 
work out a solution to the company’s problems.
If the company’s creditors and the company cannot agree, the 
company may be wound up (see 12.3).

Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/202512.1A Restructuring
If a company experiences financial problems, the directors may 
appoint a small business restructuring practitioner to help the 
company develop a plan to restructure.
If the company’s creditors do not agree to the plan, the company 
may be placed in voluntary administration (see 12.1) or wound up 
(see 12.3).
[Part 5.3B]
12.2 Receivers
A receiver, or receiver and manager, may be appointed by order of 
a Court or under an agreement with a secured creditor to take over 
some or all of the assets of a company. Generally this would occur 
if the company is in financial difficulty. A receiver may be 
appointed, for example, because an amount owed to a secured 
creditor is overdue.
[Part 5.2]
12.3 Winding up and distribution
A company may be wound up by order of a Court, or voluntarily if 
the shareholders of the company pass a special resolution to do so.
A liquidator is appointed:
• when a Court orders a company to be wound up; or
• the shareholders of a company pass a resolution to wind up 
the company.
[Parts 5.4, 5.4B, 5.5].
12.4 Liquidators

• to determine debts owed by the company and pay the 
company’s creditors; and
• to distribute to shareholders any assets of the company left 
over after paying creditors (any distribution to shareholders 
is made according to the rights attaching to their shares); 
and
• finally, to have the company deregistered.
[Parts 5.4B, 5.6]
12.5 Order of payment of debts
Generally, creditors who hold security interests in company assets 
are paid first.
[Division 6 of Part 5.6]
12.6 Cancellation of registration
If a company has ceased trading or has been wound up, it remains 
on the register until ASIC cancels the company’s registration. Once 
a company is deregistered, it ceases to exist.

124  Legal capacity and powers of a company
(1) A company has the legal capacity and powers of an individual both 
in and outside this jurisdiction. A company also has all the powers 
of a body corporate, including the power to:
(a) issue and cancel shares in the company;
(b) issue debentures (despite any rule of law or equity to the 
contrary, this power includes a power to issue debentures that 
are irredeemable, redeemable only if a contingency, however 
remote, occurs, or redeemable only at the end of a period, 
however long);
(c) grant options over unissued shares in the company;
(d) distribute any of the company’s property among the 
members, in kind or otherwise;
(e) grant a security interest in uncalled capital;

redeemable preference shares, see section 254A.

fact that the company’s interests are not, or would not be, served 
by doing it.
(3) For the avoidance of doubt, this section does not:
(a) authorise a company to do an act that is prohibited by a law 
of a State or Territory; or
(b) give a company a right that a law of a State or Territory 
denies to the company.
(4) Subsection (1) does not prevent a mutual entity that is a company 
limited by guarantee issuing MCIs.
125  Constitution may limit powers and set out objects
(1) If a company has a constitution, it may contain an express 
restriction on, or a prohibition of, the company’s exercise of any of 
its powers. The exercise of a power by the company is not invalid 
merely because it is contrary to an express restriction or prohibition 
in the company’s constitution.
(2) If a company has a constitution, it may set out the company’s 
objects. An act of the company is not invalid merely because it is 
contrary to or beyond any objects in the company’s constitution.
126  Agent exercising a company’s power to make contracts and 
execute documents (including deeds)
(1) A company’s power to make, vary, ratify or discharge a contract, 
or execute a document (including a deed), may be exercised by an 
individual acting with the company’s express or implied authority 
and on behalf of the company.
Note 1: If a company executes a document in this way, people will be able to 
rely on the assumptions in subsection 129(3) for dealings in relation to 
the company.

(1) If a person enters into, or purports to enter into, a contract on 
behalf of, or for the benefit of, a company before it is registered,

a substitute for it:
(a) within the time agreed to by the parties to the contract; or
(b) if there is no agreed time—within a reasonable time after the 
contract is entered into.

the company would be liable to pay to the party if the company had 
ratified the contract and then did not perform it at all.
(3) If proceedings are brought to recover damages under subsection (2) 
because the company is registered but does not ratify the

167AC  Meaning of MCI mutual entity
A mutual entity is an MCI mutual entity if:
(a) the entity is a public company; and
(b) the entity does not have voting shares (other than MCIs) 
quoted on a declared financial market; and
(c) the entity is not a registered entity within the meaning of the 
Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 
2012; and
(d) the entity’s constitution states that the entity is intended to be 
an MCI mutual entity for the purposes of this Act; and
(e) the entity has issued one or more MCIs.
167AD  Meaning of MCI
(1) A share in a mutual entity is an MCI (short for mutual capital 
instrument) if:
(a) paragraphs 167AC(a), (b), (c) and (d) apply to the entity; and
(b) the share meets the requirements in sections 167AE and 
167AF.
(2) To avoid doubt, if a share that is an MCI ceases to meet one or 
more of those requirements, the share ceases to be an MCI.
(3) Nothing in this Division requires an MCI mutual entity to treat the 
holders of MCIs in the same way as members of the entity who do 
not hold MCIs.
Note: For example, this Division does not require an MCI mutual entity that 
provides services to a class of members to provide those services to 
holders of MCIs.

167AG  MCIs must be cancelled before MCI mutual entity 
demutualises
A resolution of an MCI mutual entity that would result in the entity 
ceasing to be an MCI mutual entity can only take effect if:
(a) there are no MCIs in the entity; or
(b) the resolution provides for each MCI to be cancelled at or 
before the time the entity ceases to be an MCI mutual entity 
(whether or not the holders of the MCIs to be cancelled are to

(1) This Subdivision applies in relation to a public company if its 
constitution allows its directors to set a limit (a board limit) whose 
effect is to restrict the number of directors of the company to a 
number less than the maximum number of directors specified in the 
constitution.
Note: This Subdivision applies however the constitution or board limit is 
expressed.
(2) If a company’s constitution provides that the maximum number of 
directors is either a specified number or another number 
determined by the directors:
(a) any number determined by the directors that is lower than the 
specified number is a board limit; and
(b) any lowering by the directors of that lower number is also a 
board limit.
(3) Subsection (2) does not limit, and is not limited by, subsection (1).
201P  Directors must not set board limit unless proposed limit has 
been approved by general meeting
(1) The directors must not set a board limit unless:
(a) a resolution (a board limit resolution) approving the proposal 
to set the limit specified in the resolution has been passed by 
a general meeting of the company; and
(b) the notice of the meeting set out an intention to propose the 
board limit resolution and stated the resolution; and

Corporations Act 2001 399
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(c) the notice was accompanied by a statement explaining the 
resolution and meeting the requirements in section 201Q.
Note 1: Subsection 249L(3) requires information in the notice of meeting to be 
presented clearly, concisely and effectively.
Note 2: Section 201U specifies the consequences of a contravention of 
subsection (1) of this section. Also, section 1324 provides for 
injunctions to enforce subsection (1) of this section.
(2) A board limit resolution has effect until immediately before the 
start of the first AGM of the company after the general meeting by 
which the resolution was passed.
(3) A board limit resolution does not prevent the appointment of a 
person as a director of the company by the other directors of the 
company between general meetings of the company.
(4) However, if a person is appointed by the other directors as a 
director of the company while a board limit resolution has effect, 
the company must confirm the appointment by resolution at the 
company’s next AGM. If the appointment is not confirmed, the 
person ceases to be a director of the company at the end of the 
AGM.
(5) Subsections (1), (2) and (4) have effect despite the company’s 
constitution.
Note: Although subsection (4) is like subsection 201H(3) in many ways, it is 
not a replaceable rule like subsection 201H(3).

Application
(1) This section applies if the directors of the company set a board

Board limit etc. ineffective
(2) The board limit and anything done in reliance on it have no effect 
for the purposes of:
(a) the company’s constitution; or
(b) this Act, except this section.
Note: If a board limit resolution is not passed, the number of directors of a 
company that can be appointed (for example by a general meeting) 
depends on the maximum number of directors specified by the 
company’s constitution. This is so even if the directors purport to set a 
board limit despite the fact the board limit resolution was not passed.
(3) If:
(a) one or more directors are appointed by one or more 
resolutions passed at a particular general meeting of the 
company; and
(b) because of the board limit, the general meeting was not given 
the opportunity to pass one or more resolutions appointing a 
number of directors such that the number of directors of the 
company would (if those resolutions had been passed) have 
exceeded the board limit;
every appointment of director made by a resolution passed at the 
general meeting is invalid.

acts by a director in circumstances where the director’s appointment is 
invalid for certain reasons.

(5) Subsection (6) applies if either of the following (the suffering 
party) suffers loss or damage because of the setting of the board 
limit in contravention of subsection 201P(1):
(a) the company;
(b) a person for whom both the following conditions are met:
(i) the person had given the company a written indication 
that he or she would be a candidate to be appointed 
director at a general meeting;
(ii) because of the board limit, the general meeting was not 
given the opportunity to consider passing a resolution to 
appoint the person as director.
(6) The suffering party may institute a proceeding in the Court for the 
contravention.

legally effective if the person doing them is a secretary (for example, 
signing and sending out a notice of a meeting of directors if the

(a) has not vested in the member; or
(b) has vested in the member but remains subject to a holding 
lock.
(2) Without limiting paragraph (1)(a), remuneration that is not payable 
to a member until a particular day is, until that day, remuneration 
that has not vested in the member.

subsection (1) in relation to an element of remuneration described 
in that subsection, regard is to be had to the regulations (if any) 
made for the purposes of this subsection.
(4) A member of the key management personnel for a company who 
contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence.

company immediately after the spill meeting apart from this 
section.
Note: Subsection 201A(2) requires the company to have at least 3 directors.
(2) Enough directors to ensure that the company has 3 directors 
immediately after the spill meeting are taken to have been 
appointed, by resolution passed at the spill meeting, from the 
persons who:
(a) gave the company signed consents to act as directors of the 
company in anticipation of being appointed by such a 
resolution; and
(b) were not appointed as directors by such a resolution apart 
from this section.
Note: The number of directors taken under subsection (2) to have been 
appointed is the difference between 3 and the number of directors 
holding office immediately after the spill meeting apart from this 
section.
(3) The persons taken to have been appointed are those with the 
highest percentages of votes favouring their appointment cast at the 
spill meeting on the resolution for their appointment (even if less 
than half the votes cast on the resolution were in favour of their 
appointment).
Example: Suppose that, under subsection (2), 2 directors are taken to have been 
appointed, and the percentages of votes favouring appointment were 
50% for Jean, 40% for Karl and 30% for Lionel. Jean and Karl would 
both be taken to have been appointed directors, but Lionel would not.
(4) For the purposes of this section, if 2 or more persons have the same 
percentage of votes favouring their appointment, the one of those 
persons chosen by the director or directors who hold office apart 
from this subsection is taken to have a higher percentage than the 
rest of those persons.
Note: A director who holds office apart from subsection (4) could make a

254SA  Companies limited by guarantee not to pay dividends
A company limited by guarantee must not pay a dividend to its 
members.
254T  Circumstances in which a dividend may be paid
(1) A company must not pay a dividend unless:
(a) the company’s assets exceed its liabilities immediately before 
the dividend is declared and the excess is sufficient for the 
payment of the dividend; and
(b) the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the 
company’s shareholders as a whole; and
(c) the payment of the dividend does not materially prejudice the 
company’s ability to pay its creditors.
Note 1: As an example, the payment of a dividend would materially prejudice 
the company’s ability to pay its creditors if the company would 
become insolvent as a result of the payment.
Note 2: For a director’s duty to prevent insolvent trading on payment of 
dividends, see section 588G.
Note 3: Section 1230M applies to a CCIV instead of this section.
(2) Assets and liabilities are to be calculated for the purposes of this 
section in accordance with accounting standards in force at the 
relevant time (even if the standard does not otherwise apply to the 
financial year of some or all of the companies concerned).
254U  Other provisions about paying dividends (replaceable rule—see 
section 135)
(1) The directors may determine that a dividend is payable and fix:
(a) the amount; and
(b) the time for payment; and

The methods of payment may include the payment of cash, the 
issue of shares, the grant of options and the transfer of assets.
(2) Interest is not payable on a dividend.
254V  When does the company incur a debt?
(1) A company does not incur a debt merely by fixing the amount or 
time for payment of a dividend. The debt arises only when the time 
fixed for payment arrives and the decision to pay the dividend may 
be revoked at any time before then.
(2) However, if the company has a constitution and it provides for the 
declaration of dividends, the company incurs a debt when the 
dividend is declared.
254W  Dividend rights
Shares in public companies
(1) Each share in a class of shares in a public company has the same 
dividend rights unless:
(a) the company has a constitution and it provides for the shares 
to have different dividend rights; or
(b) different dividend rights are provided for by special 
resolution of the company.
Note: Section 1230N is about dividend rights in a CCIV.
Shares in proprietary companies (replaceable rule—see 
section 135)
(2) Subject to the terms on which shares in a proprietary company are 
on issue, the directors may pay dividends as they see fit.
No liability companies
(3) A person is not entitled to a dividend on a share in a no liability 
company if a call:

(4) Dividends are payable to the shareholders in a no liability company 
in proportion to the number of shares held by them, irrespective of 
the amount paid up, or credited as paid up, on the shares. This 
subsection has effect subject to any provisions in the company’s 
constitution relating to shares that are not ordinary shares.
254WA  Application of this Part to MCI mutual entities
(1) Section 254SA does not prevent an MCI mutual entity that is a 
company limited by guarantee paying a dividend in respect of an 
MCI.
(2) Without limiting section 254T, an MCI mutual entity must not pay 
a dividend unless the payment of the dividend is fair and 
reasonable to the entity’s members as a whole.

Part 2J.1—Share capital reductions and share 
buy-backs
  
256A  Purpose
This Part states the rules to be followed by a company for 
reductions in share capital and for share buy-backs. The rules are 
designed to protect the interests of shareholders and creditors by:
(a) addressing the risk of these transactions leading to the 
company’s insolvency
(b) seeking to ensure fairness between the company’s 
shareholders
(c) requiring the company to disclose all material information.

Division 1  Reductions in share capital not otherwise authorised by law
Section 256B
598 Corporations Act 2001
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025Division 1—Reductions in share capital not otherwise 
authorised by law
Note: This Division does not apply to a CCIV: see subsection 1231A(5).
256B  Company may make reduction not otherwise authorised
(1) A company may reduce its share capital in a way that is not 
otherwise authorised by law if the reduction:
(a) is fair and reasonable to the company’s shareholders as a 
whole; and
(b) does not materially prejudice the company’s ability to pay its 
creditors; and
(c) is approved by shareholders under section 256C.
A cancellation of a share for no consideration is a reduction of 
share capital, but paragraph (b) does not apply to this kind of 
reduction.
Note 1: One of the ways in which a company might reduce its share capital is 
cancelling uncalled capital.
Note 2: Sections 258A-258F deal with some of the other situations in which 
reductions of share capital are authorised. Subsection 254K(2) 
authorises capital reductions involved in the redemption of 
redeemable preference shares and subsection 257A(2) authorises 
reductions involved in share buy-backs.
Note 3: For a director’s duty to prevent insolvent trading on reductions of 
share capital, see section 588G.
Note 4: For the criminal liability of a person dishonestly involved in a 
contravention of subsection 256D(1) based on this subsection, see 
subsection 256D(4). Section 79 defines involved.
Note 5: A company may reduce its share capital for the purposes of the 
conversion and write-off provisions determined by APRA despite this 
Division (see Subdivision B of Division 1A of Part II of the Banking 
Act 1959, Division 2 of Part IIIA of the Insurance Act 1973 and 
Division 1A of Part 10A of the Life Insurance Act 1995).
(1A) To avoid doubt, a cancellation of a partly-paid share is taken to be 
for consideration.

Reductions in share capital not otherwise authorised by law  Division 1
Section 256C
Corporations Act 2001 599
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(2) The reduction is either an equal reduction or a selective reduction. 
The reduction is an equal reduction if:
(a) it relates only to ordinary shares; and
(b) it applies to each holder of ordinary shares in proportion to 
the number of ordinary shares they hold; and
(c) the terms of the reduction are the same for each holder of 
ordinary shares.
Otherwise, the reduction is a selective reduction.
(3) In applying subsection (2), ignore differences in the terms of the 
reduction that are:
(a) attributable to the fact that shares have different accrued 
dividend entitlements; or
(b) attributable to the fact that shares have different amounts 
unpaid on them; or
(c) introduced solely to ensure that each shareholder is left with 
a whole number of shares.
256C  Shareholder approval
Ordinary resolution required for equal reduction
(1) If the reduction is an equal reduction, it must be approved by a 
resolution passed at a general meeting of the company.
Special shareholder approval for selective reduction
(2) If the reduction is a selective reduction, it must be approved by 
either:
(a) a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the 
company, with no votes being cast in favour of the resolution 
by any person who is to receive consideration as part of the 
reduction or whose liability to pay amounts unpaid on shares 
is to be reduced, or by their associates; or
(b) a resolution agreed to, at a general meeting, by all ordinary 
shareholders.

under subsection (2) within 14 days after it is passed. The company 
must not make the reduction until 14 days after lodgment.

under Part 2C.2.
Information to accompany the notice of meeting
(4) The company must include with the notice of the meeting a 
statement setting out all information known to the company that is 
material to the decision on how to vote on the resolution. However, 
the company does not have to disclose information if it would be 
unreasonable to require the company to do so because the company 
had previously disclosed the information to its shareholders.
Documents to be lodged with ASIC
(5) Before the notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders, the 
company must lodge with ASIC a copy of:
(a) the notice of the meeting; and
(b) any document relating to the reduction that will accompany 
the notice of the meeting sent to shareholders.
256D  Consequences of failing to comply with section 256B
(1) The company must not make the reduction unless it complies with 
subsection 256B(1).
(2) If the company contravenes subsection (1):
(a) the contravention does not affect the validity of the reduction 
or of any contract or transaction connected with it; and
(b) the company is not guilty of an offence.
(3) Any person who is involved in a company’s contravention of 
subsection (1) contravenes this subsection.

Exceeding the 10/12 limit
(5) A proposed buy-back would exceed the 10/12 limit if the number 
of votes attaching to:
(a) all the voting shares in the company that have been bought 
back during the last 12 months; and
(b) the voting shares that will be bought back if the proposed 
buy-back is made;

made by a listed corporation on a declared financial market in the 
ordinary course of trading on that market.
(7) A buy-back by a company (whether listed or not) is also an 
on-market buy-back if it results from an offer made in the ordinary 
course of trading in a financial market outside Australia which 
ASIC declares in writing to be an approved overseas financial 
market for the purposes of this subsection. A buy-back by a listed 
company is an on-market buy-back under this subsection only if an 
offer to buy-back those shares is also made on a declared financial 
market at the same time.

258B  Right to occupy or use real property
(1) If a company has a constitution, under it the company may grant to 
a shareholder, as a shareholder, a right to occupy or use real

for, or in satisfaction of, a right to occupy or use the land of the 
kind referred to in subsection (1).
Example: A person has a right to occupy an apartment in a block of units

258G  Application of this Part to MCI mutual entities
(1) For the purposes of applying this Part to an MCI mutual entity, a 
reference (other than in section 258B) to a shareholder of the entity 
is taken to include a non-shareholder mutual member of the entity.
(2) For the purposes of applying Division 1 to an MCI mutual entity:
(a) any reduction of the entity’s share capital that relates to MCIs 
is taken to be a selective reduction; and
(b) the reference to all ordinary shareholders in 
paragraph 256C(2)(b) is taken to be a reference to all 
members of the entity.
(3) For the purposes of applying Division 2 to an MCI mutual entity:
(a) any scheme to buy back MCIs is taken not to be an equal 
access scheme; and
(b) subsections 257B(4) and (5) (the 10/12 limit) have effect in 
relation to MCIs issued by a mutual entity as if each MCI 
were a voting share with one vote attached to it; and
(c) the reference to all ordinary shareholders in 
paragraph 257D(1)(b) is taken to be a reference to all

entity as a share.

Corporations Act 2001 619
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025259E  When a company controls an entity
(1) For the purposes of this Part, a company controls an entity if the 
company has the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions 
about the entity’s financial and operating policies.
(2) In determining whether a company has this capacity:
(a) the practical influence the company can exert (rather than the 
rights it can enforce) is the issue to be addressed; and
(b) any practice or pattern of behaviour affecting the entity’s 
financial or operating policies is to be taken into account 
(even if it involves a breach of an agreement or a breach of 
trust).
(3) Merely because the company and an unrelated entity jointly have 
the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about another 
entity’s financial and operating policies, the company does not 
control the other entity.
(4) A company is not taken to control an entity merely because of a 
capacity that it is under a legal obligation to exercise for the benefit 
of someone other than its shareholders.
