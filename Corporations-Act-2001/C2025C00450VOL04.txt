terms
Subdivision A—Preliminary
762A  Overview of approach to defining what a financial product is
General definition
(1) Subdivision B sets out a general definition of financial product. 
Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a facility is a financial product if 
it falls within that definition.
Specific inclusions
(2) Subdivision C identifies, or provides for the identification of, kinds 
of facilities that, subject to subsection (3), are financial products 
(whether or not they are within the general definition).
Overriding exclusions
(3) Subdivision D identifies, or provides for the identification of, kinds 
of facilities that are not financial products. These facilities are not 
financial products:
(a) even if they are within the general definition; and
(b) even if they are within a class of facilities identified as 
mentioned in subsection (2).
762B  What if a financial product is part of a broader facility?
If a financial product is a component of a facility that also has 
other components, this Act, in applying to the financial product, 
only applies in relation to the facility to the extent it consists of the 
component that is the financial product.
Note: So, e.g., Part 7.9 does not require disclosures to be made in relation to 
those other components.

In this Act:
facility includes:
(a) intangible property; or
(b) an arrangement or a term of an arrangement (including a term 
that is implied by law or that is required by law to be 
included); or
(c) a combination of intangible property and an arrangement or 
term of an arrangement.
Note: 2 or more arrangements may be taken to constitute a single 
arrangement: see subsection 761B(2).
Subdivision B—The general definition
763A  Meaning of financial product
(1) A financial product is a facility through which, or through the 
acquisition of which, a person does one or more of the following:
(a) makes a financial investment;
(b) manages financial risk;
(c) makes non-cash payments.
This has effect subject to section 763E.
(2) A particular facility that is of a kind through which people 
commonly make financial investments, manage financial risks or 
make non-cash payments is a financial product even if that facility 
is acquired by a particular person for some other purpose.
(3) A facility does not cease to be a financial product merely because:
(a) the facility has been acquired by a person other than the 
person to whom it was originally issued; and
(b) that person, in acquiring the product, was not making a 
financial investment or managing a financial risk.

Section 763B
30 Corporations Act 2001
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025763B  Meaning of makes a financial investment
A person (the investor) makes a financial investment if:
(a) the investor gives money or money’s worth (the 
contribution) to another person and any of the following 
apply:
(i) the other person uses the contribution to generate a 
financial return, or other benefit, for the investor;
(ii) the investor intends that the other person will use the 
contribution to generate a financial return, or other 
benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in 
fact generated);
(iii) the other person intends that the contribution will be 
used to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for 
the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact 
generated); and
(b) the investor has no day-to-day control over the use of the 
contribution to generate the return or benefit.
Note 1: Examples of actions that constitute making a financial investment 
under this subsection are:
(a) a person paying money to a company for the issue to the person 
of shares in the company (the company uses the money to 
generate dividends for the person and the person, as a 
shareholder, does not have control over the day-to-day affairs of 
the company); or
(b) a person contributing money to acquire interests in a registered 
scheme from the responsible entity of the scheme (the scheme 
uses the money to generate financial or other benefits for the 
person and the person, as a member of the scheme, does not have 
day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme).
Note 2: Examples of actions that do not constitute making a financial 
investment under this subsection are:
(a) a person purchasing real property or bullion (while the property 
or bullion may generate a return for the person, it is not a return 
generated by the use of the purchase money by another person); 
or
(b) a person giving money to a financial services licensee who is to 
use it to purchase shares for the person (while the purchase of the 
shares will be a financial investment made by the person, the 
mere act of giving the money to the licensee will not of itself 
constitute making a financial investment).

would be a financial product because of this Subdivision is:
(i) an incidental component of a facility that also has other 
components; or
(ii) a facility that is incidental to one or more other

Provision of traditional trustee company services by trustee 
company
(1A) Subject to paragraph (2)(b), the provision by a trustee company of 
a traditional trustee company service constitutes the provision, by 
the company, of a financial service.
Note: Trustee companies may also provide other kinds of financial service 
mentioned in subsection (1).
(1B) The regulations may, in relation to a traditional trustee company 
service of a particular class, prescribe the person or persons to 
whom a service of that class is taken to be provided. This 
subsection does not limit (and is not limited by) subsection (2).
Note: A traditional trustee company service is provided to a person as a 
retail client unless regulations provide otherwise (see

(a) the circumstances in which persons facilitating the provision 
of a financial service (for example, by publishing 
information) are taken also to provide that service; or
(b) the circumstances in which persons are taken to provide, or 
are taken not to provide, a financial service.
Exception for work ordinarily done by clerks or cashiers
(3) To avoid doubt, a person’s conduct is not the provision of a 
financial service if it is done in the course of work of a kind 
ordinarily done by clerks or cashiers.
Meaning of operating a registered scheme
(4) For the purposes of this section, a person is not operating a 
registered scheme merely because:
(a) they are acting as an agent or employee of another person; or
(b) they are taking steps to wind up the scheme.
Overlap between financial services
(5) The fact that conduct constitutes the provision of a financial 
service is not to be taken to imply that the conduct does not also 
constitute the provision of another financial service.
Note: For example, conduct may constitute providing a superannuation 
trustee service and also providing another financial service (such as 
dealing in a financial product that is a superannuation product).
766B  Meaning of financial product advice, personal advice and 
general advice
(1)Financial product advice means a recommendation or a statement 
of opinion, or a report of either of those things, that:
(a) is intended to influence a person or persons in making a 
decision in relation to a particular financial product or class

product or class of financial products; or
(b) could reasonably be regarded as being intended to have such 
an influence.
(1A) However, subject to subsection (1B), the provision or giving of an 
exempt document or statement does not constitute the provision of 
financial product advice.
(1B) Subsection (1A) does not apply for the purpose of determining 
whether a recommendation or statement of opinion made by an 
outside expert, or a report of such a recommendation or statement 
of opinion, that is included in an exempt document or statement is 
financial product advice provided by the outside expert.
(2) There are 2 types of financial product advice: personal advice and 
general advice.
(3)Personal advice is financial product advice that is given or directed 
to a person (including by electronic means) in circumstances 
where:
(a) the provider of the advice has considered one or more of the 
person’s objectives, financial situation and needs (otherwise 
than for the purposes of compliance with the Anti-Money 
Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 or 
with regulations, or AML/CTF Rules, under that Act); or
(b) a reasonable person might expect the provider to have 
considered one or more of those matters.
(3A) However, the acts of asking for information solely to determine 
whether a person is in a target market for a financial product, and 
of informing the person of the result of that determination, do not, 
of themselves, constitute personal advice.
(4)General advice is financial product advice that is not personal 
advice.
(5) The following advice is not financial product advice:

(a) in response to a request made by a person (the inquirer) to 
another person (the provider), the provider tells the inquirer 
the cost, or an estimate of the likely cost, of a financial 
product (for example, an insurance product); and
(b) that cost or estimate is worked out, or said by the provider to 
be worked out, by reference to a valuation of an item (for 
example, a house or car to which an insurance policy would 
relate), being a valuation that the provider suggests or 
recommends to the inquirer;
the acts of telling the inquirer the cost, or estimated cost, and 
suggesting or recommending the valuation, do not, of themselves,

(b) issuing a financial product;
(c) in relation to securities and interests in managed investment 
schemes—underwriting the securities or interests;
(d) varying a financial product;
(e) disposing of a financial product.
(2) Arranging for a person to engage in conduct referred to in 
subsection (1) is also dealing in a financial product, unless the 
actions concerned amount to providing financial product advice.
(2A) Despite subsections (1) and (2), providing a crowd-funding service 
does not constitute dealing in a financial product.

derivatives on a futures market and that enables the calculation of 
payments that market participants owe by way of margins would also 
be a clearing and settlement facility (assuming that the relevant 
obligations are of a kind prescribed by regulations made for the

incorporated in Australia, under statutory management; 
and
(b) compulsorily transferring all or part of the shares of, or 
business of, the licensee, or a related body corporate that 
is incorporated in Australia, to another body corporate; 
and

(1) This Subdivision applies for the purpose of determining, for the 
purposes of a provision of this Division:
(a) whether:
(i) proposed compensation arrangements are adequate; or
(ii) compensation arrangements as proposed to be changed 
are adequate; or
(b) whether compensation arrangements that have been approved 
are adequate.
(2) A reference in this Subdivision to the arrangements is a reference 
to the proposed arrangements, the arrangements as proposed to be 
changed, or the arrangements that have been approved, as the case 
requires.
(3) A reference in this Subdivision to the compensation rules is a 
reference to the compensation rules, or the proposed compensation 
rules, forming part of the arrangements under consideration.
885B  Requirements to be complied with for arrangements to be 
adequate
(1) The arrangements are adequate if, and only if, ASIC is satisfied 
that:
(a) the compensation rules provide adequate coverage for 
Division 3 losses (see sections 885C and 885D); and
(b) the compensation rules provide for adequate compensation to 
be paid in respect of Division 3 losses (see section 885E); 
and
(c) the compensation rules deal adequately with how 
compensation in respect of Division 3 losses is to be paid 
(see section 885F); and

Section 885C
Corporations Act 2001 345
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025(d) the compensation rules deal adequately with the making and 
determination of claims in respect of Division 3 losses, and 
with the notification of the outcome of such claims (see 
section 885G); and
(e) the arrangements provide for an adequate source of funds for 
paying compensation, or providing compensation in a form 
other than money, in respect of Division 3 losses and in 
respect of any other losses covered by the arrangements (see 
section 885H); and
(f) the arrangements include adequate arrangements for 
administration and monitoring (see section 885I); and
(g) under the arrangements, potential claimants have reasonable 
and timely access to the compensation regime; and
(h) if the licensee ceases (for whatever reason) to be required to 
have Division 3 arrangements, the rights of people to seek 
compensation under the arrangements, being rights that 
accrued while the licensee was required to have such 
arrangements, will be adequately protected.
(2) In considering the matters mentioned in subsection (1), ASIC must 
also have regard to the matters mentioned in section 885J.
(3) The matters that may be dealt with in compensation rules are not 
limited to matters mentioned in this section.
885C  The losses to be covered
(1) Subject to section 885D, the compensation rules must cover losses 
(Division 3 losses) of a kind described in the following paragraphs:
(a) a person (the client) gave money or other property, or 
authority over property, to a person (the participant):
(i) who was a participant in the market at that time; or
(ii) who the client reasonably believed to be a participant in 
the market at that time and who was a participant in the 
market at some earlier time; and
(b) the money or other property, or the authority, was given to 
the participant in connection with effecting a transaction, or

346 Corporations Act 2001
Compilation No. 143 Compilation date: 09/07/2025proposed transaction, covered by provisions of the operating 
rules of the market relating to transactions effected through 
the market; and
(c) the effecting of the transaction through the market constitutes 
or would constitute the provision of a financial service to the 
client as a retail client; and
(d) the client suffers a loss because of:
(i) if the client gave the participant money or other 
property—the defalcation or fraudulent misuse of the 
money or other property by the participant; or
(ii) if the client gave the participant authority over 
property—the fraudulent misuse of that authority by the 
participant.
(2) The compensation rules must provide that a claim relating to an 
alleged loss caused by defalcation or fraudulent misuse may be 
allowed even if:
(a) the person against whom the defalcation or misuse is alleged 
has not been convicted or prosecuted; and
(b) the evidence on which the claim is allowed would not be 
sufficient to establish the guilt of that person on a criminal 
trial in respect of the defalcation or fraudulent misuse.
(3) The compensation rules may exclude losses of a kind described 
above that occur in specified situations. However, the 
compensation arrangements will not be adequate unless ASIC is 
satisfied that those exclusions are appropriate.
885D  Certain losses that are not Division 3 losses
(1) If, in relation to a loss suffered by a person:
(a) the requirements of subsection 885C(1) are satisfied in 
relation to a participant and 2 or more financial markets; and
(b) the person did not (expressly or impliedly) instruct the 
participant to use a particular one of those markets; and

relation to a participant and a financial market; and
(b) the loss is also connected (see section 888A) with a financial 
market to which Division 4 applies; and
(c) the person did not (expressly or impliedly) instruct the 
participant to use a particular one of those markets; and
(d) it is not reasonably apparent from the usual business practice 
of the participant which of those markets the participant

(a) the transaction referred to in paragraph 885C(1)(b) could 
have been effected otherwise than through a financial market; 
and
(b) the person did not (expressly or impliedly) instruct the 
participant concerned to effect the transaction through a 
financial market; and

of compensation to which a person is entitled in respect of a claim 
in particular circumstances, or an upper limit on the total amount of 
compensation to which persons are entitled in respect of claims

(4) That upper limit may be specified in the compensation rules or 
determined by a method specified in the rules.
(5) The compensation rules must also provide for the payment to the

Division 1—Preliminary
908AA  Simplified outline of this Part
Administrators of significant financial benchmarks must be 
licensed under this Part. Administrators of other financial 
benchmarks may voluntarily opt in to the same licensing scheme.
Licensees are subject to certain obligations.
ASIC may make financial benchmark rules that apply in relation to 
licensees and the financial benchmarks they administer.
ASIC may also make compelled financial benchmark rules to deal 
with circumstances such as the failure of a licensee to administer a 
significant financial benchmark specified in its licence.
Offences and civil penalty provisions apply to conduct that could 
unduly manipulate a financial benchmark.
908AB  Meaning of financial benchmark
(1) A financial benchmark is a price, estimate, rate, index or value 
that:
(a) is made available to users (whether or not for a fee); and
(b) is calculated periodically from one or more:
(i) transactions, instruments, currencies, prices, estimates, 
rates, indices, values, financial products, bank accepted 
bills or negotiable certificates of deposit; or
(ii) other interests or goods (whether tangible or intangible); 
and
(c) is referenced or otherwise used for purposes that include one 
or more of the following:

(iii) calculating the value of a financial product, bank 
accepted bill or negotiable certificate of deposit;
(iv) measuring the performance of a financial product, bank 
accepted bill or negotiable certificate of deposit.
(2) However, the regulations, or ASIC by written instrument, may 
provide that a price, estimate, rate, index or value is not a financial 
benchmark.
(3) Such an instrument by ASIC is a legislative instrument if it is 
expressed to apply in relation to a class of prices, estimates, rates, 
indices or values (whether or not it is also expressed to apply in 
relation to one or more prices, estimates, rates, indices or values 
identified otherwise than by reference to membership of a class).
(4) If subsection (3) does not apply to an instrument by ASIC under 
subsection (2), ASIC must publish the instrument.
908AC  Meaning of significant financial benchmark
(1) A significant financial benchmark is a financial benchmark that is 
declared under subsection (2).
(2) ASIC may, by legislative instrument, declare a financial 
benchmark to be a significant financial benchmark if ASIC is 
satisfied that:
(a) the benchmark is systemically important to the Australian 
financial system; or
(b) there is a material risk of financial contagion, or systemic 
instability, in Australia if the availability or integrity of the 
benchmark were disrupted; or

subsection 908AC(2) without the consent of the Minister if ASIC 
is of the opinion that it is necessary, or in the public interest, to do 
so in order to protect:
(a) the Australian economy; or
(b) the efficiency, integrity and stability of the Australian 
financial system.
(2) If ASIC makes a declaration under subsection 908AC(2) without 
the consent of the Minister, ASIC must:
(a) provide the Minister, on the following day, with a written 
explanation of the need for the declaration; and
(b) revoke the declaration in accordance with any direction under 
subsection (3).
(3) The Minister may give ASIC a written direction to revoke a

or
(ii) the licensee applied under paragraph 914A(2)(b) for 
ASIC to take the proposed action; or

(1) If a financial services licensee, or a related body corporate, is a 
body (the APRA body) regulated by APRA, other than an ADI 
(within the meaning of the Banking Act 1959), the following 
provisions apply:
(aa) ASIC cannot suspend or cancel the licensee’s licence if the 
licensee is authorised to provide a superannuation trustee 
service unless:
(i) APRA has agreed in writing with the proposed action; 
or
(ii) the licensee applied under paragraph 915B(1)(e), (2)(d), 
(3)(d) or (4)(d) for ASIC to take the proposed action; or
(iii) the licensee’s RSE licence is not in effect, and is not 
treated by section 29GB of the Superannuation Industry 
(Supervision) Act 1993 as if it were in effect;
(a) if paragraph (aa) does not apply, ASIC cannot suspend or 
cancel the licensee’s licence if doing so would, in ASIC’s 
opinion, have the result of preventing the APRA body from 
being able to carry on all or any of its usual activities (being 
activities in relation to which APRA has regulatory or 
supervisory responsibilities), unless ASIC has first consulted 
APRA about the proposed action;
(b) if ASIC suspends or cancels the licensee’s licence and 
paragraphs (aa) and (a) do not apply to that action, ASIC 
must, within one week, inform APRA of the action that has 
been taken.
(2) If:
(a) a financial services licensee is an ADI (within the meaning of 
the Banking Act 1959); or
(b) a related body corporate of a financial services licensee is an 
ADI (within the meaning of the Banking Act 1959), and 
cancellation or suspension of the licensee’s licence would, in 
ASIC’s opinion, have the result of preventing the ADI from 
being able to carry on all or any of its banking business 
(within the meaning of the Banking Act 1959);

(c) subject to paragraph (d), the powers that ASIC would 
otherwise have under this Subdivision to cancel or suspend

to which this subsection applied, are instead powers of the 
Minister;
(d) the procedures for the exercise of a power to which 
paragraph (c) applies are the same as would apply if ASIC 
could exercise the power, except that the Minister must not 
exercise the power unless he or she has first considered 
advice from ASIC on the proposed action, being advice given 
after ASIC has consulted APRA about the proposed action;
(e) ASIC (rather than the Minister) must still conduct any 
hearing required under paragraph 915C(4)(a) and receive any 
submissions under paragraph 915C(4)(b).
(3) A failure to comply with a requirement of this section to consult or 
inform APRA about, or to consider advice from ASIC about, or to 
get the agreement of APRA about, a suspension or cancellation, or 
a revocation of a suspension, of a licence does not invalidate the

(1) A financial services licensee may give a person (the authorised 
representative) a written notice authorising the person, for the 
purposes of this Chapter, to provide a specified financial service or 
financial services on behalf of the licensee.
Note: There are limitations on a financial services licensee authorising an 
individual to provide certain personal advice if the individual does not 
meet certain requirements (see section 921C).
(2) The financial services specified may be some or all of the financial 
services covered by the licensee’s licence.

purports to authorise a person to provide a financial service:
(a) that is not covered by the licensee’s licence; or
(b) contrary to a banning order or disqualification order under 
Division 8; or
(c) in contravention of subsection 921C(2).

written notice to the authorised representative.

licensee may, in that capacity, give an individual a written notice 
authorising that individual, for the purposes of this Chapter, to 
provide a specified financial service or financial services on behalf 
of the licensee, but only if the licensee consents in writing given to 
the authoriser.
Note: There are limitations on sub-authorising an individual to provide 
certain personal advice if the individual does not meet certain 
requirements (see section 921C).
(3A) An individual who is authorised as mentioned in subsection (3)

giving written notice to the individual.
(8) If a person revokes the authorisation of an individual under 
subsection (7), that person must inform, in writing, the other 
person who could have revoked the authorisation.
(9) To avoid doubt, an authorisation given as mentioned in 
subsection (3) is taken, for the purposes of sections 916C to 916F, 
to be given by the authoriser, not the licensee.
916C  Authorised representative of 2 or more licensees
(1) One person can be the authorised representative of 2 or more 
financial services licensees, but only if:
(a) each of those licensees has consented to the person also being 
the authorised representative of each of the other licensees; or
(b) each of those licensees is a related body corporate of each of 
the other licensees; or
(c) the only financial services provided by the person as 
authorised representative of any financial services licensee 
are claims handling and settling services.
(2) A purported authorisation given in breach of this requirement is 
void.
(3) A person must not give a purported authorisation if that purported 
authorisation is in breach of this requirement.

authorisation is given in breach of this requirement.
Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see

services licensee from being an authorised representative in 
circumstances covered by section 916E.
Note: In a prosecution for an offence based on subsection (2A), a defendant 
bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in this subsection. 
See subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code.
(3) As well, an authorisation that starts to breach this requirement, 
because the person authorised is subsequently granted an 
Australian financial services licence, is void.
916E  Licensees acting under a binder
(1) Despite section 916D, a financial services licensee (the authorised 
licensee) may be the authorised representative of another financial 
services licensee who is an insurer, if the authorised licensee acts 
under a binder given by the insurer.
(2) For all purposes connected with contracts that are risk insurance 
products, or with claims against the insurer, in respect of which the 
authorised licensee acts under the binder:
(a) the authorised licensee is taken to act on behalf of the insurer 
and not the insured; and
(b) if the insured in fact relied in good faith on the conduct of the 
authorised licensee, the authorised licensee is taken to act on 
behalf of the insurer regardless of the fact that the authorised 
licensee did not act within the scope of the binder.

from providing that service, unless:
(i) APRA agrees in writing to the making of the banning 
order; or
(ii) the licensee’s RSE licence is not in effect, and is not 
treated by section 29GB of the Superannuation Industry 
(Supervision) Act 1993 as if it were in effect;

good faith, for valuable consideration and without notice of the 
facts entitling the client to give the notice.

If a financial services licensee is, in providing a financial service, 
acting as the authorised representative of another financial services

(b) the providing entity has not had a reasonable opportunity to 
give (in accordance with section 940C) the client the 
document, information or statement by the time they are

information or statement to the client as required by the provision 
is not a contravention of the provision.
Note: In a prosecution for an offence, a defendant bears an evidential burden 
in relation to the matters in this section (see subsection 13.3(3) of the 
Criminal Code).

being a statement, or an omission, that is or would be 
materially adverse from the point of view of a reasonable 
person considering whether to proceed to be provided with 
the financial service concerned; or
(b) if the disclosure document or statement is a Statement of 
Advice, a Cash Settlement Fact Sheet, or information, a 
statement or a copy of a record required by 
subsection 946AA(5), 946B(3), (6) or (8) or 946C(2):

materially adverse from the point of view of a reasonable 
person considering whether to act in reliance on the advice 
concerned.

(1A) For the avoidance of doubt, if section 941E (information must be

Guide, then, for the purposes of the definition of defective in 
subsection (1):
(a) if the circumstance constituting the non-compliance is that 
particular information included in the Financial Services 
Guide is not as up to date as section 941E requires it to be—
the information so included constitutes a misleading 
statement in the Financial Services Guide; and
(b) if the circumstance constituting the non-compliance is a 
failure to include particular information that was not 
previously required to be included in the Financial Services 
Guide—the failure to include the information constitutes an 
omission from the Statement of material required by 
section 942B or 942C.
Note 1: The effect of section 943D (information in a Supplementary Financial 
Services Guide is taken to be contained in the Financial Services 
Guide it supplements) must be taken into account in determining 
whether section 941E is complied with in relation to a Financial 
Services Guide.
Note 2: Whether the inclusion of out of date information, or the failure to 
include information, results in the Financial Services Guide being 
defective as defined in subsection (1) depends on whether the 
materiality test set out in that definition is satisfied.
(1B) For the avoidance of doubt, if section 943L (obligation to keep 
website disclosure information up to date) is not complied with in 
relation to website disclosure information, then, for the purposes of

subsection 1311(1)).
Note 2: In a prosecution for an offence, the defendant bears an evidential 
burden in relation to conduct being excluded conduct (see

For relief from liability to a civil penalty relating to this subsection, 
see section 1317S.
(2) A person is not taken to have failed to take reasonable steps for the 
purpose of subsection (1) merely because:
(a) retail product distribution conduct of a regulated person 
(other than the person) in relation to the product is 
inconsistent with the target market determination; or
(b) a retail client who is not in the target market for the product 
acquires the product.
